Use this platform with caution.
Use this platform only with exchange accounts that do not have more than you can lose.
Use this platform as though it might be malicious code.
It has not had any security audit whatsoever.
Ensure that your API Key/Secret can only be accesible from your server's IP address.
Ensure that you disable withdrawels on the API key/Secret that you use with this software and only enable it if you are going to be using it to withdraw.
This platform is capable of creating buy/sell on market/margin orders that can drain your exchange balances.
There could be bots that will collect the buy/sell market orders from a different account that could essentially steal your funds.
The code can create margin orders that might cause immediate liquidation of your account.
It is not safe to use this software on a system that has any unencrypted software or encrypted software with the keys.
Do not put other bots on the same operating system since they might contain your API Keys/Secrets with withdraw enabled and this software could potentially access those keys.
Do not trust updates that you pull from this repository since someone could get into my server and push a bad copy to github. 
I do have my github keys password protected and access github with a Key/Secret as is available by github.

## The code in this repository is running at http://www.nickelbot.com/

I hope that you use this code to build your own custom web apps and web bots while also contributing the the common platform.
There is opportunity for many people to build businesses around this platform if everyone contributes.
