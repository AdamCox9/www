These are the adapter and native rest api classes.

TODO:
 - This needs to be organized into a clean directory structure and this directory structure needs to be defined.
    + Maybe it should be renamed to /class/ instead of /adapters/ since that it is misleading.
 - There should be a base Adapter class since there is some duplicate functionality in the Adapters.
 - It would be best to take as much functionality out of each Adapter class and put into the Base Adapter class.
