Reported by <a href=\"http://www.behindthefirewalls.com/\">Javier Nieto Arevalo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.devconsole.info/\">Andres Rojas Guerrero</a>.</li>\n<li>Additional protections for server-side request forgery attacks when WordPress makes HTTP requests. Reported by Ben Bidner (vortfu).</li>\n<li>An extremely unlikely hash collision could allow a user&#8217;s account to be compromised, that also required that they haven&#8217;t logged in since 2008 (I wish I were kidding). Reported by <a href=\"http://david.dw-perspective.org.uk\">David Anderson</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress now invalidates the links in a password reset email if the user remembers their password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported separately by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MomenBassel\">Momen Bassel</a>, <a href=\"http://c0dehouse.blogspot.in/\">Tanoy Bose</a>, and <a href=\"https://managewp.com/\">Bojan Slavković of ManageWP</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 4.0.1 also fixes 23 bugs with 4.0, and we&#8217;ve made two hardening changes, including better validation of EXIF data we are extracting from uploaded photos.

Unlike previous release cycles, feature plugins that are likely to be merged into WordPress have been <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/29/dev-chat-summary-january-28th/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/01/29/dev-chat-summary-january-28th/\">assigned a core mentor</a> at the beginning of the cycle. Assigning mentors at the beginning of the dev cycle should help make the merge process smoother and keep each project within scope.</p>\n<h2>Improved Communication</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest issues I have with feature plugins is the lack of communication regarding their progress on the <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make Core</a> blog. This issue is being addressed with weekly updates that explain what&#8217;s changed, things to test, and where focus is needed. The following plugins are candidates that may be included in 4.2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/\">Press This</a> &#8211; Uses the <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/press-this/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/press-this/\">Press This tag</a> on the Make Core blog.</li>\n<li><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-theme-switcher/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-theme-switcher/\">Customizer Theme Switcher</a> &#8211; Uses the <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/customizer-theme-switcher/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/customizer-theme-switcher/\">Customer Theme Switcher</a> tag on the Make Core blog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improved Testing Opportunities</h2>\n<p>If you browse to the Add New plugins screen in a development version of WordPress, you&#8217;ll see a Beta Testing tab. The tab provides easy access to feature plugins that are currently in development. My primary gripe with testing feature plugins is that they&#8217;re usually not synched with their Github counterparts where most of the development occurs.</p>\n<p>WordPress core developer, Dion Hulse, <a title=\"https://github.com/dd32/Github-to-WordPress-Plugins-Sync\" href=\"https://github.com/dd32/Github-to-WordPress-Plugins-Sync\">created a script</a> specifically to sync feature plugins on Github to the WordPress plugin directory. This allows feature plugins to have nightly releases which are available from the plugin directory. This small but important change makes it a lot easier to keep up with and upgrade feature plugins.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WP42BetaTestingTab.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[38159]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-38225\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WP42BetaTestingTab.png?resize=1025%2C382\" alt=\"WordPress 4.2 Feature Plugin Beta Testing Tab\" /></a>WordPress 4.2 Feature Plugin Beta Testing Tab\n<p>It&#8217;s still early in the development cycle, but I&#8217;m impressed with Jaynes organizational abilities. He&#8217;s addressed some of the largest pain points to the feature plugin process. If the changes put the experimental model back on track, future lead developers will have an easier time managing the program.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 23:32:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"WPTavern: StackExchange Community Building Beta Provides a Valuable Resource for Digital Community Managers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=38086\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"http://wptavern.com/stackexchange-community-building-beta-provides-a-valuable-resource-for-digital-community-managers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5295:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/plants.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[38086]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/plants.jpg?resize=1025%2C505\" alt=\"plants\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38240\" /></a></p>\n<p>Online community building is like gardening.

The lack of separation of menu data from the theme means that users are locked into that theme and their content is not transferable.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not the case with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/auberge\" target=\"_blank\">Auberge</a>, a new free theme from Oliver Juhas of <a href=\"http://www.webmandesign.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">WebMan Design</a>. Last week we featured Juhas&#8217; <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/modern-a-beautiful-free-blog-and-portfolio-theme-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Modern</a> theme, which was built to showcase portfolios. Modern requires Jetpack for managing portfolio posts, and Auberge takes the same approach for menus.</p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s home page features a large header image, with blog posts and/or an optional food menu preview displayed beneath.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/auberge.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[38161]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/auberge.jpg?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"auberge\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38163\" /></a></p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/auberge/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see how the <a href=\"http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/auberge/menu/\" target=\"_blank\">menu page</a> is divided into sections.

The theme also requires <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack</a> to support many of the features you see in the demo, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Food menu posts</li>\n<li>Featured content setup (banner area)</li>\n<li>Tiled galleries</li>\n<li>Image lightbox zooming effect</li>\n<li>Infinite Scroll</li>\n<li>Sharing buttons</li>\n<li>Site icon, favicon, and image logo</li>\n<li>Related posts, CDN, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Auberge utilizes WordPress&#8217; native customizer to offer layout options for the placement of the blog posts and food menu sections on the home page. You can also customize the header background and text colors, accent color, footer and widget colors. The customizer also contains options to set the basic font size and select Google Font combinations based on recommendations from the <a href=\"http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Web Fonts Typographic Project</a>.</p>\n<p>If you like the layouts seen in the demo site, the theme&#8217;s author has prepared all the markup for each page to copy into your pages. You can find this in the &#8220;Demo Content Page Layouts&#8221; section of the theme&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.webmandesign.eu/manual/auberge/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Auberge has support for post formats as well as the unique ability to split posts and pages into <a href=\"http://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/auberge/post-parts/\" target=\"_blank\">multiple parts</a>. It also supports Schema.org markup, Google Recipe View, and Theme Hook Alliance action hooks.</p>\n<p>Auberge was built based on Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores</a> starter theme. Juhas designed it to be lean, so any extra functionality comes in the form of plugins. The theme itself contains no shortcodes, sliders, or page builders.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a restaurant or cafe theme that includes menu content the right way, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/auberge\" target=\"_blank\">Auberge</a> is a solid option. It allows you to select a different theme further down the road without losing all of your content. You can find it via your admin themes browser or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/auberge\" target=\"_blank\">download</a> it directly from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 20:20:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"Matt: Designer’s Creed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/designers-creed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1790:\"<p>You might remember a <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/\">few years back I talked about why Automattic has a creed, and shared ours</a>.

I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I&#8217;ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it&#8217;s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.

There&#8217;s no prescribed file structure, so when you look under the hood of a plugin, you often need to poke around a bit to find out how the author is organizing things.</p>\n<p>Jason Agnew found this to be confusing when he went to build his first WordPress plugin. Agnew is the technical director at <a href=\"http://bigbitecreative.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Bite Creative</a>, located in Middlesbrough, England. He often collaborates with both front and back end developers on projects, which drove him to find a better way to write plugins that are organized for multiple team members.</p>\n<p>This week Agnew introduced <a href=\"http://getherbert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Herbert</a>, a new open source framework for building WordPress plugins. &#8220;We believe the current approach to building plugins is unorganized and difficult to understand,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;It makes working in teams or taking over from a previous developer time consuming. Its early days for Herbert but our aim is to solve this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prior to creating Herbert with his team, Agnew did his homework to see if there was an existing tool to solve this problem. He discovered the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate-3-0-released-with-new-community-website\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate</a> project, but determined that it wouldn&#8217;t work for his agency&#8217;s needs. &#8220;Although WPPB would be a great starting point, it seemed best suited to the quick development of smaller plugins,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;We needed something more suited to scale.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He checked out some of the most popular WordPress plugins, hoping to find a common thread among them for a semantic, structured method of plugin creation. &#8220;To our surprise, there wasn’t any sense of uniformity or consistency of implementation among them,&#8221; he said. At that point, he rallied his team to write their own WordPress plugin framework.</p>\n<p>The open source <a href=\"http://getherbert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Herbert</a> project was born out of this effort. The framework aims to keep business logic separate from template code, so that back and frontend developers aren&#8217;t tripping over each other. &#8220;It offers a file structure to keep your code organised, with a solution as simple as all your routes belonging in the plugin/routes.php file,&#8221; Agnew said. &#8220;It no longer ties you or your development team to the WordPress Database Object ($wpdb), allowing you to use the power and effectiveness of <a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/eloquent\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel’s Eloquent ORM</a> to handle your database queries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Herbert utilizes Composer to handle the framework&#8217;s dependencies. Template code is stored in <a href=\"http://getherbert.com/dev/views\" target=\"_blank\">views</a>, which uses the <a href=\"http://twig.sensiolabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Twig</a> PHP templating engine. The framework may not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. However, if you like separating your code into routes, views, and controllers, then Herbert may save you some time when spinning up new plugins.</p>\n<p>The Big Bite Creative team plans to maintain the framework and will add plugin examples in the future. &#8220;We plan to introduce an interface to the WordPress post object for Eloquent, along with tests for your code,&#8221; Agnew said. They are also considering adding a WordPress-specific frontend framework to work alongside Herbert. The project is open to contribution, so feel free to fork Herbert on <a href=\"https://github.com/getherbert/herbert/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and send code back to the team.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 23:55:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: Chris Lema’s Session From PressNomics 3 on Managing Time and Energy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=38135\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://wptavern.com/chris-lemas-session-from-pressnomics-3-on-managing-time-and-energy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:968:\"<p>One of my favorite sessions at <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/envato-stats-tips-for-getting-things-done-and-more-at-pressnomics-3\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/envato-stats-tips-for-getting-things-done-and-more-at-pressnomics-3\">PressNomics 3</a> is now <a title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD9XtifLp9Y\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD9XtifLp9Y\">available to watch for free</a> on YouTube.

Last year&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp in Sofia, Bulgaria</a> was a tremendous success with nearly 800 attendees, a world-class speaker lineup, and a strong local community of volunteers.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, the WCEU organizers select a host city based on applications from various European WordPress communities after an open call. However, this year is an exception. WordCamp Central prevailed upon the team to have the event in late spring or summer in order to accommodate WordCamp US, which is expected to take place in the fall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we had to move WordCamp Europe to the first half of the year, we were quite limited in time,&#8221; organizer Petya Raykovska said. &#8220;So instead of publishing an open call for applications, we decided to reach out to some of the best established WordPress communities in Europe that have experienced teams of local organizers and asked them to prepare bids to host WCEU 2015. We received three very good applications from three different teams.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WCEU organization team landed on Seville after considering various factors, such as the local organizers&#8217; preparation of the budget and venue research. &#8220;We chose Seville because of the excellent job they did with the application,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;But also because of the great, experienced local team, because it’s a great location with a very different vibe from Sofia &#8211; it’s affordable, well connected with the rest of Europe, and has a very strong local WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress community in Seville has held a local <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wcsevilla\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp</a> for the past several years. The city&#8217;s metropolitan area has approximately 1.5 million residents, making it a decent-sized city for hosting an event. Attendees should expect to pack for warm weather, as the Seville&#8217;s average high temperatures in the summer often reach above 35 °C.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://siobhanmckeown.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Siobhan McKeown</a> will be leading a team of 18 <a href=\"http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/organizers/\" target=\"_blank\">organizers</a> for the 2015 event, including five experienced local organizers and a global team of organizers from all over Europe.</p>\n<p>Tickets will go on sale at the beginning of February, and the organization team will be calling for speakers and sponsors in the next few days. Unlike last year&#8217;s event, WordCamp Europe 2015 will include interpretation for the local language. While all sessions will be given in English, a Spanish translation will be offered simultaneously.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 20:37:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Why Jetpack Comments is Not A Great Alternative to WordPress’ Native Comment Form\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=38091\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"http://wptavern.com/why-jetpack-comments-is-not-a-great-alternative-to-wordpress-native-comment-form\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7500:\"<p>Jetpack ships with more than <a title=\"http://jetpack.me/\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/\">30 different modules </a>including, <a title=\"http://jetpack.me/support/comments/\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/comments/\">Jetpack Comments</a>.

The error was caused by a security setting with <a title=\"http://www.modsecurity.org/\" href=\"http://www.modsecurity.org/\">mod_security</a> on DreamHost and exposed the lack of a graceful fallback. Instead of displaying an error, the iFrame should have been replaced with the native comment form. I <a title=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/446\" href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/446\">created an issue</a> on Github explaining the problem and although it gained immediate attention, not much has happened since.</p>\n<h2>Annoying Page Refreshes</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s normal for articles on the Tavern to have several comments with multi-threaded conversations. I&#8217;ve discovered that Jetpack Comments will sometimes take me to a different part of the page after I reply to a comment instead of taking me to where the comment is published. It doesn&#8217;t happen all the time, but when it does, it&#8217;s annoying.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s 2015, 10 years after the term <a title=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/\" href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/\">Ajax was coined by Jesse James Garrett</a>. Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript + XML. It&#8217;s a collection of technologies that provide near real-time interaction with page elements. For example, if you leave a comment on a site running the <a title=\"http://p2theme.com/\" href=\"http://p2theme.com/\">P2 theme</a>, it will appear on the site without refreshing the page.</p>\n<p>Page refreshes are distracting, annoying, and break the flow of a conversation. I&#8217;m <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-was-expected-some-other-fu?replies=2\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-was-expected-some-other-fu?replies=2\">not the first one</a> to request Jetpack Comments be Ajaxified. In an <a title=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/833#issuecomment-67605046\" href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/833#issuecomment-67605046\">issue on Jetpack&#8217;s Github account</a>, George Stephanis, who is a member of the Jetpack development team explains that, while theoretically possible, it&#8217;s not high on the priority list.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s theoretically possible passing the event through JS <code>window.postMessage</code> &#8212; but to actually render the comment would take some theme integration that we can&#8217;t presently assume. If someone wanted to write this I&#8217;d be fine accepting a pull request that fires an event and passes some limited data back, like the comment ID and status or something, but it&#8217;s not high on the priority list.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The ticket has gained little traction with no signs of Ajax support being added anytime soon. His response is similar to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s in <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg\">episode 130 of WordPress Weekly</a>, when I asked him <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/what-is-the-future-of-comments-in-wordpress\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/what-is-the-future-of-comments-in-wordpress\">why comments haven&#8217;t changed much</a> in WordPress over the years, “It’s very difficult to iterate comments as it’s hard to get those changes to be compatible with every WordPress theme in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s Not Highly Extendable</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest problems I have with Jetpack Comments is that it&#8217;s not easily extendable using plugins. Since it&#8217;s an iFrame hosted on WordPress.com, it&#8217;s hard to manipulate and is an <strong>all or nothing </strong>approach.</p>\n<h2>The Old Comment Form</h2>\n<p>In 2011, I used <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-mimic-the-wptavern-commenting-system\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-mimic-the-wptavern-commenting-system\">a collection of plugins</a> to add features to the native comment form so it felt more like a reply box on a forum. Readers had the ability to style and preview comments without having to write code. They could also subscribe to the thread and edit their comment afterwards for up to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>However, my favorite feature was the Reply link next to each comment. When clicked, the name along with a link to the comment id was automatically added to the comment form. For example, <strong>@&lt;a href=&#8221;#comment-11784&#8243; rel=&#8221;reply&#8221;&gt;Name of Awesome Commenter&lt;/a&gt; &#8211; Comment text here</strong>. Since the theme didn&#8217;t support threaded comments at the time, this feature came in handy.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/OldTavernCommentForm.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[38091]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-38095\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/OldTavernCommentForm.png?resize=625%2C657\" alt=\"Comment Form Used on The Tavern in 2011\" /></a>Comment Form Used on The Tavern in 2011\n<p>Although some of the features are replicated in Jetpack Comments, the old form felt like a better experience to me. If you&#8217;re a long time commenter on the Tavern, I&#8217;m curious if you feel the same way?</p>\n<h2>I Don&#8217;t Recommend Jetpack Comments</h2>\n<p>In an era where Twitter, Facebook, etc. provide the ability for real-time communication, Jetpack Comments and the default comment system in WordPress feels like ancient technology. If all you need is an easy way for people to login using their social media accounts to post a comment, Jetpack Comments is a good solution.

The <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/pressable-struggles-to-retain-customers-following-recent-outages\" target=\"_blank\">recent outages</a> caused some customers 24+ hours of downtime and many closed their accounts in favor of finding an alternative host. Today the company announced that the root cause of the outage customers experienced the week of January 19, 2015, was an intentional attack on Pressable&#8217;s systems.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://pressable.com/blog/2015/01/28/root-cause-analysis-outage-week-january-19-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the company&#8217;s blog further breaks down the attack: <strong>&#8220;Ultimately, the reason for this outage was a well crafted attack on our systems. The attack was a variant of the “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_%28software%29\" target=\"_blank\">Slow-Loris</a>” attack discovered in 2009.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>The attack went undetected because of the insidious manner in which it was executed. Pressable has been working with security professionals to get the attack under control and announced <a href=\"http://status.pressable.com/2015/01/24/all-systems-operational/\" target=\"_blank\">all systems operational</a> on Monday.</p>\n<p>A week ago, after hearing about Pressable&#8217;s continued struggle with downtime, I asked CEO Vid Luther if the company was being intentionally sabotaged. At the time, he didn&#8217;t think that an attack was a real possibility:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I do not believe that anyone who has an agenda against Pressable is behind these issues. I&#8217;m not aware of anyone who has an agenda against Pressable, besides the general competition in the WordPress hosting space, and currently, some of them are acting like vultures. But, I don&#8217;t think those guys have the ability to orchestrate something like this. So, unfortunately, no conspiracy theory from our side.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While working to mitigate customer downtime, the Pressable team discovered the coordinated attack on their systems. The attacker&#8217;s sophisticated method of sabotaging Pressable went undetected, because it was made to appear that the host&#8217;s infrastructure was being overloaded.</p>\n<p>The knowledge of the attack came after multiple apologies from Luther, who originally identified Pressable&#8217;s lagging infrastructure as the cause. Luther told the Tavern that he has an idea of who the attackers are but will be digging into it further before calling out any parties publicly.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 22:43:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: GenerateWP Introduces WordPress Custom Code Snippets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=37861\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"http://wptavern.com/generatewp-introduces-wordpress-custom-code-snippets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5357:\"<p><a href=\"http://generatewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GenerateWP</a>, the popular WordPress code generator site, is celebrating two years in operation this week. The site, founded by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ramiy\" target=\"_blank\">Rami Yushuvaev</a>, launched with five code generators and now has more than 20. Yushuvaev sees the site as an educational tool that helps WordPress developers learn more about coding best practices.</p>\n<p>Before launching GenerateWP, Yushuvaev created <a href=\"http://www.wp-tricks.co.il/generator/\" target=\"_blank\">three code generators</a> to serve the Israeli WordPress community. The site was an instant success, which prompted him to translate it into English and launch GenerateWP in January 2013.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/generatewp-hebrew.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37861]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/generatewp-hebrew.jpg?resize=727%2C221\" alt=\"generatewp-hebrew\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38035\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first week after launching, Yushuvaev was approached by a major brand that offered to buy the site and a few developers made offers to finance more generators. &#8220;I decided that it wasn’t the right time to give up the site, since I had big plans for it and for the WordPress community,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The site has 15K+ registered WordPress developers and averages 100,000 visitors per month, most of whom are designers and developers. During the past two years, Yushuvaev worked with contributors Maor Chasen and Ohad Raz to rewrite the entire code base to use object-oriented programming and make it work better with WordPress.</p>\n<p>In celebration of the site&#8217;s two year birthday, GenerateWP is introducing custom code snippets, which will allow users to save their own snippets in a public and/or private library. &#8220;Front-end designers use <a href=\"http://Codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">codepen.io</a> to showcase their code, JavaScript developers use <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net\" target=\"_blank\">jsfiddle.net</a>, Bootstrap developers have <a href=\"http://bootsnipp.com\" target=\"_blank\">bootsnipp.com</a>, and now WordPress developers have <a href=\"http://GenerateWP.com\" target=\"_blank\">GenerateWP.com</a>,&#8221; Yushuvaev said.</p>\n<p>The site now includes a collective <a href=\"http://generatewp.com/snippet/\" target=\"_blank\">library of public snippets</a> shared with the community. Users can also browse public snippets by author.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rami-snippets.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37861]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rami-snippets.jpg?resize=963%2C458\" alt=\"rami-snippets\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38047\" /></a></p>\n<p>Individual <a href=\"http://generatewp.com/snippet/nvMganl/\" target=\"_blank\">snippets</a> allow users to share, download, or clone the code into their own libraries. Developers can embed snippets on their sites, send them to <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pastebin</a>, or create a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub gist</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/generatewp-snippets.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37861]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/generatewp-snippets.jpg?resize=957%2C483\" alt=\"generatewp-snippets\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-38049\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Future Plans for Expanding GenerateWP</h3>\n<p>Yushuvaev has plans to monetize the site further down the road but said that the generators and code snippets will always remain free. &#8220;The money will come from other services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t reveal our plans but you can expect a game changing feature for our premium users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the team plans to create new code generators, including a tool to generate widgets, a meta box generator, and admin menu page generators. In the coming weeks, the site will also provide an oEmbed option to embed snippets using nothing but the URL.</p>\n<p>Currently, the most popular generators on the site are the ones for creating custom post types, shortcodes, and custom taxonomies. Yushuvaev is optimistic that the site will continue to grow as more developers discover how much time they can save with the generators.</p>\n<p>I was writing the same code over and over again (post types and taxonomies) for different clients,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Creating an automatic generator to save some time was the next logical step.&#8221; He found that writing code eats up plenty of time and did not want to utilize free plugins, as they often do not remain in active development.</p>\n<p>GenerateWP is quickly becoming a popular tool for WordPress educators. &#8220;The site is used in WordPress classes around the world to teach new developers how to properly code using WordPress coding standards,&#8221; Yushuvaev said. &#8220;We managed to confirm a class in Thailand, universities and colleges in Israel, United States, Canada, and Germany.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We also have received requests to translate our tools to other languages,&#8221; he said. The GenerateWP team plans to add translations in the near future to open up the site to more international users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 21:20:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"Matt: Slack Buys Screenhero\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44638\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/slack-buys-screenhero/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:534:\"<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/slack-buys-screenhero-to-add-screen-sharing-and-voice-chat-to-its-work-messaging-platform/\">Slack Buys Screenhero To Add Screen Sharing And Voice Chat To Its Work Messaging Platform</a>, which I&#8217;m very excited about as a daily user of Slack (on 5 teams now) and through <a href=\"http://audrey.co/\">Audrey</a> an investor in <a href=\"https://screenhero.com/\">Screenhero</a> and a big fan of their vision.

Getting 2-3 items finished each day builds confidence and provides a historical record of things that are done.</p>\n<p>His stance on putting family first is an important strategy I need to work on.

Although the session wasn&#8217;t recorded, the audience tweeted out the highlights of the interview, and discussion continued on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Strebel pressed Mullenweg on Automattic&#8217;s agenda behind <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>At <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pressnomics?src=hash\">#pressnomics</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/strebel\">@strebel</a> refers to Jetpack as a Trojan Horse to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt\">@photomatt</a>, room goes silent</p>\n<p>&mdash; Yeti Support (@YetiSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YetiSupport/status/558772539032219648\">January 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>This resulted in one of the most controversial statements to come out of the event:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>“In the absence of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetpack\">@Jetpack</a>, I believe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash\">#WordPress</a> would be declining.” &#8211; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pressnomics?src=hash\">#pressnomics</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Antony McGregor Dey (@antonymd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antonymd/status/558772451199299584\">January 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mullenweg further clarified his statement on Twitter, essentially identifying Jetpack as a tool to bolster the platform against competition.

Many self-hosted WordPress users don&#8217;t appreciate the fact that the mobile apps are packed full of WordPress.com features, but, at the moment, there are no superior alternatives. In our most recent <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Mullenweg</a>, he deftly addressed the friction caused by <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/poll-who-uses-reader-in-the-wordpress-mobile-apps\" target=\"_blank\">the preeminence of WordPress.com’s Reader in the app</a>, which he sees as a gateway that simplifies the onboarding process for new users.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I see it as a gateway drug and it gives people more options down the road. If we don’t do anything on mobile, five years from now, when everyone is only using mobile devices, they will all have Squarespace’s or Weebly’s. WordPress is still around but it just doesn&#8217;t matter. This allows us to matter five years from now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With both Jetpack and the mobile apps, Mullenweg sees an opportunity for Automattic to provide functionality that goes beyond the core publishing experience to offer mobile access and connect users with readers and commenters via social networks.</p>\n<h3>The Road to 50% Market Share</h3>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e048-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Adam Silver on the KitchensinkWP podcast</a>, Mullenweg gave a better overall picture of his next goal for WordPress and how he sees the platform reaching more users in the future. The software is currently used on <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all\" target=\"_blank\">23.3% of websites worldwide</a> and is on track to reaching 25% before the end of the year. Mullenweg hopes to grow that number to 50%:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The next goal is the majority of websites. We want to get to 50%+ and there&#8217;s a lot of work between now and then. As the percentage increases, it gets harder and harder to grow the market share, and we have to grow the market share by doing things we haven&#8217;t done in the past &#8211; really thinking about the onboarding process, really thinking about the integration with social networks, and with how WordPress works on touch devices, which is going to be the predominant computing platform of the future. These things are going to be really important.</p>\n<p>What got us here isn&#8217;t going to get us there. Once we get to 50%, we can decide something new we want to do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With a focus on the onboarding process, integration with social networks, and mobile publishing, Mullenweg is outlining how he sees the mobile apps and Jetpack entering the picture to grow the market share and prevent the decline of the platform.</p>\n<p>For Mullenweg, a 50% market share with a growing international user base isn&#8217;t a purely business goal, but rather ties back in with WordPress&#8217; mission to democratize publishing with open source software. In response to Silver&#8217;s question on whether or not the recent focus on the mission is connected to an increase in non-English downloads, Mullenweg replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The big assumption in what we&#8217;re doing is that there&#8217;s an inherent goodness to the transparency and the ability for people to publish. Of course people use WordPress to publish things I personally disagree with or might find morally odious. But it&#8217;s very important that we provide the people the opportunity to have that voice. </p>\n<p>By giving everyone equal ability and access to reach the web, you&#8217;re a click away from several billion people. But you&#8217;re not if you don&#8217;t have the tools to really reach them. It&#8217;s not hunger or clean water or any of the big problems that society has, climate change, but at least for our little part in it, I think we can make a pretty big dent in it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg knew that WordPress had the potential to have an enormous impact on the world of publishing, even when the software was still batting in the minor leagues. WordPress.com was originally created to help users set up blogs while bypassing what used to be a complicated hosting and installation process. Over the years, as WordPress.com adapted more sophisticated ways of supporting the average WordPress user, the idea of Jetpack was born to connect self-hosted blogs with the same features.</p>\n<p>The question is whether or not Jetpack and the mobile apps are the missing link for helping users get connected to billions of people. While Jetpack&#8217;s features aren&#8217;t necessarily unique, they are professionally-supported and users feel safe banking on the plugin for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s controversial statement about WordPress being in decline without Jetpack was phrased as conjecture, because there&#8217;s no objective way to prove this unless you remove Jetpack from the picture entirely. As he further explained in his Twitter reply, the notion is based on witnessing the decline of other publishing systems that aren&#8217;t innovating with social or mobile features.</p>\n<p>Those who disagree with the statement object to the idea of hinging the success of WordPress&#8217; market share on a plugin produced by a commercial entity. This is especially provocative when it comes to mobile, as Automattic&#8217;s agenda to promote WordPress.com features goes unrivaled. Nevertheless, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t have a mobile publishing platform without the company&#8217;s subsidy of the open source apps.</p>\n<p>If WordPress is dependent on Jetpack to continue building its market share to 50%, then the software&#8217;s future is inextricably tied to Automattic&#8217;s continued success. The company is one of a small few that have the capital to invest in a major plugin like Jetpack along with the ongoing improvement of the mobile apps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year, Automattic raised a bit more funding than we have in the past,&#8221; Mullenweg told Silver in his interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually bigger than most IPO&#8217;s. We raised $160 million and that gives us a lot of capital to invest into the community. We&#8217;re able to make bigger bets, longer term bets, and it also solidifies us as an independent entity for many years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress open source project can still be considered a success in terms of its mission, even if it doesn&#8217;t achieve a dominant market share. Tying its growth to Jetpack is a bold statement that eclipses some of WordPress&#8217; best qualities, such as its rigid adherence to protecting user freedoms with the GPL, the strong community of contributors, and the massive ecosystem of products and services surrounding it. The availability of Jetpack may be one factor responsible for WordPress&#8217; growing market share, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the sole tool saving WordPress from decline.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:27:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Post Status: WooCommerce is going after photography\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=7728\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-photography/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7576:\"<p>Photography is a huge &#8212; and quite competitive &#8212; market. WooThemes has one nice advantage, in that they are quite dominant in the eCommerce space.</p>\n<p>However, catering to actually selling photos is a whole new world. You&#8217;re talking about competing with dozens of services, some quite vertically integrated (from website, to photo management, to photo fulfillment), to a very picky audience full of people with unique workflows.</p>\n<p>I am not a photographer. However, last year I did a ton of research on photography product potential in the WordPress space. I was working with <a href=\"http://ran.ge\">Range</a>, and we were exploring creating our own photography product. I interviewed a dozen professional photographers in person, ranging in industry, experience, and company size.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot during that research phase; and one thing I learned is that this is no easy venture.</p>\n<p>The new WooCommerce photography extension does one thing quite nicely: it allows a photographer to create albums where customers can bulk purchase photos, and it allows the photographer to upload the photos for purchase, as well as protect the albums so that only the photography client can view them.</p>\n<p>You can view a marketing video, walkthrough video, and screenshots for <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-photography/\">WooThemes&#8217; Photography extension</a> on the dedicated product page.</p>\n<h3>Considerations for true professional photo management / sales</h3>\n<p>However, that is one piece of the puzzle. This plugin makes the client-side of ordering relatively painless, but there are other elements to think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrowing an album from a lot of photos to fewer photos</li>\n<li>Choosing to make an album visible to a wedding party or others that may want to purchase, in addition to a client</li>\n<li>Creating a more visual gallery of an album, versus a &#8220;purchase&#8221; view</li>\n<li>Enabling uploads to be synchronous with an editing tool, like Lightroom</li>\n<li>Enabling categorization, automated meta data, and various grouping mechanisms for photos</li>\n<li>The ability to quickly send the same or select photos from a client-viewed album to a new gallery for a blog post about a client event</li>\n<li>Integrating a photo fulfillment service, to actually print and deliver purchased photos</li>\n<li>And much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure WooThemes has done a good bit of research for this product. However, I think they&#8217;ve made a feature that&#8217;s not yet ready for your every day photographer. Of the photographers I met, most lamented the experience of creating, managing, and selling photos and albums.</p>\n<p>I think that there is a lot of room in the self-hosted photography space, and my reasoning is simple. Right now, selling photos and managing albums, client review, etc., on hosted services is super expensive. Plenty of services charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year, and/or charge massive per-purchase fees (like 10%+).</p>\n<p>A self-hosted, WordPress-integrated photography management solution &#8212; built for WordPress professionals &#8212; could be a million dollar idea on its own. I think WooCommerce creating this add-on is an interesting start, but I believe the concept has major legs that could grow into something huge.</p>\n<h3>Here are some other players in the market</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start within the WordPress space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.photocrati.com/photography-wordpress-themes/\">Photocrati</a> &#8212; a theme plus eCommerce, gallery, and other features (these are the folks behind NextGen)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://graphpaperpress.com/plugins/sell-media/\">Sell Media</a> &#8212; Graph Paper Press&#8217;s spin on selling media and prints. If I recall correctly, this is a fork of EDD customized for their photo-heavy theme collection</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.prophoto.com/explore-features/\">ProPhoto</a> &#8212; hideous but one of the more &#8220;full service&#8221; photography website options, minus selling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> &#8212; Out of the box, EDD could be used for selling photos</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ithemes.com/exchange/\">Exchange</a> &#8212; Out of the box, Exchange could be used for selling photos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No WordPress product is really providing a full solution though. Plenty of non-WordPress products are trying. Here are some that are interseting to look into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smugmug.com/pro\">SmugMug</a> &#8212; A compelling, hosted option. Probably the most interesting in the market.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.instaproofs.com/home/how-it-works.html\">InstaProofs</a> &#8212; A widely used method for proofing, selling, and fulfilling photo orders. (Requires 8%-15% commissions!)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://discover.pictage.com/features\">Pictage</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://web.shootq.com/\">ShootQ</a> &#8212; The most vertically integrated options: from initial lead to photo fulfillment. These two are quite popular, but are expensive SaaS products.</li>\n<li>There are loads of these, but these are popular ones, and give you an idea of what WordPress-oriented products are up against.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>I don&#8217;t envy professional photographers on the web</h3>\n<p>Professional photographers have a lot to juggle.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve got to manage leads, their website copy, their contacts and CRM, their galleries and portfolio, their client albums and workflow, their events, their raw copies of photos and backups, the ability for clients to buy from them, and more.</p>\n<p>Managing this entire setup online is possible, but right now a photographer with a WordPress website and a third party system for album reviews, sales, and leads is kind of lame.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote alignright\">I think WordPress can do a better job, and reduce expenses for professional photographers, while enabling them to have a more synchronized web experience for their clients.</span> I think WooCommerce introducing a Photography extension is one piece of the puzzle, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the over-arching problem.</p>\n<p>I truly believe someone could create a theme and plugin shop that competes with these third parties. But it needs to have a lot going for it: beautiful display, an easy to use interface (I&#8217;m not sure the back-end of WordPress counts as this), help photographers not continuously repeat themselves during photo management, and generally make their life as a professional photographer easier.</p>\n<p>Hosted services are tackling this problem. Those photographers managing their websites on WordPress may have more freedom and lower costs, but right now the experience isn&#8217;t easier.</p>\n<p>WooThemes is making a good first step. I&#8217;m not sure that they are the right team to really go 100% though. I&#8217;d be interested to see another company build something integrated into this product from WooThemes (or another WordPress eCommerce product) and really solve professional photographers&#8217; workflow grievances.</p>\n<p>Like I said, I interviewed about a dozen photographers from different backgrounds. None of those interviewed felt particularly satisfied with their web workflows. There is room in this market. My question is: who will fulfill their needs?</p>\n<p>I think it can be a self-hosted product or hosted product, or both. But I think WordPress should be an excellent tool for photographers, and right now it&#8217;s not.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 21:30:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: SPIEGEL Interviews Dean Baquet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44634\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/spiegel-interviews-dean-baquet/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:835:\"<blockquote><p>SPIEGEL: One of the reasons Snowden didn&#8217;t approach the New York Times was that the paper had refused to publish the initial research about the NSA&#8217;s bulk collection in 2004.

You never know what you will encounter when you venture into the comments section on <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/why-comments-still-matter\" target=\"_blank\">blogs with open discussion enabled</a>, but that&#8217;s the beauty of free expression.</p>\n<p>The Tavern has always been a place where anyone is welcome to offer opinions in the comments, even if they&#8217;re not fully polished. Oftentimes this results in some quality interaction from community leaders. We use Jetpack comments, but the module is lacking in features that add a more interactive discussion experience between commenters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://defla.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Deflame</a> is a new web app, created by <a href=\"https://github.com/alexbecker\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Becker</a>, that aims to improve the quality of discourse on the internet. Both the standalone app and the Chrome extension were built to work with WordPress sites, since the platform currently dominates the web. Deflame offers three features that allow users to &#8220;ignore asshats,&#8221; delineate a side in debate, and share their perceptions of an argument with others via a unique URL.</p>\n<p>I tested the standalone version and the Chrome extension, using a recent WP Tavern <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/heropress-launches-kickstarter-campaign-to-highlight-wordpress-developers\" target=\"_blank\">post regarding HeroPress</a>, which sparked some heated debate. The app adds radio buttons to identify comment authors with whom you agree or disagree. You also have the option to ignore comments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflama-example.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37875]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflama-example.png?resize=1025%2C1017\" alt=\"deflama-example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37889\" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear why sometimes the comments receive two radio buttons, but it&#8217;s likely that the app cannot accurately anticipate the correct placement of the buttons due to differences in comment templates. Once you mark your opinions in the comments, clicking the Chrome extension button will present a summarized table at the top of the page. It includes a unique URL that allows you to share your view of the debate with the flames dampened.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflame-summary.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37875]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deflame-summary.jpg?resize=755%2C235\" alt=\"deflame-summary\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37910\" /></a></p>\n<p>Becker hopes that the app will give users a way to frame their positions and perceptions on debates that happen in the comments. &#8220;Too often, debates over important issues devolve into reasonable people on both sides attacking the trolls or madmen they perceive as representing the opposition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Deflame aims to give commenters on WordPress-powered blogs the ability to rise above this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the app doesn&#8217;t actually affect the website on which it&#8217;s being used, it offers an independent way of presenting a user-moderated discussion. Users can show an overview of their opinions, even when a site doesn&#8217;t offer interactive voting features for comments.</p>\n<p>However, some may not be comfortable with the fact that the app&#8217;s share link hides comments that have been ignored. The ability to view all comments is the only way to get the proper context for other comments posted in a debate. If visitors arrive to a site by clicking on a Deflame-generated link, they may not understand that they are only viewing a select group of comments. For this reason, I think an additional button to &#8220;show hidden comments&#8221; would be useful.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"http://defla.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Deflame</a> is an interesting idea that might make a useful WordPress plugin, if its code licensing permits. The project is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/alexbecker/deflame\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. It includes a small <a href=\"https://github.com/alexbecker/deflame/blob/master/supported.md\" target=\"_blank\">list of supported sites</a>, though the extension works reliably on many more that are not included in the list.

Write tutorials. Share things that you learn. Learn things by writing about them. That&#8217;s how I got to know people in the community. It&#8217;s also how I was able to successfully launch Theme Hybrid.</p>\n<p>And, always reply to comments on your blog. You&#8217;ve got to interact with your readers. At a certain point, that gets tough, but keep the conversation going.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the worst thing about WordPress (the software) in your opinion? How can it be made better?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>From a pure user perspective, I&#8217;d like to see the admin simplified even more. Get rid of anything that&#8217;s not necessary. I&#8217;d drop the theme/plugin editors and tools screen for starters. Then, I&#8217;d work on figuring out how to simplify the post screen as much as possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ever curious about the future of post formats, I asked Tadlock if he likes them and if he believes they have a future. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I love post formats.

Although most contributors aren&#8217;t in it for the recognition, it&#8217;s nice for project leaders to have a way to showcase who is behind the work. The relative number of contributors on a project is often a good indicator of how many people are ultimately committed to its success.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/acknowledge-me/\" target=\"_blank\">Acknowledge Me</a> is a new plugin created by the folks behind the <a href=\"http://pods.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Pods Framework</a>. It makes it easy to output contributors for any GitHub repository onto a WordPress post, page, or PHP template.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s shortcode is configurable, so you can set the owner (the user name or organization name for the repo), the repo name, and optionally add a header and limit the number of contributors to display.</p>\n<p><code>[acknowledge_me owner=\"pods-framework\" repo=\"pods\" header_text=\"Pods Is Brought To You By:\" total=\"50\"]</code></p>\n<p>The output will generally look the same, no matter what theme you have activated. However, you may need to tweak some of the CSS in the event that the yellow mousover overlay doesn&#8217;t line up. When hovering over individual contributors, the plugin displays the number of contributions and links to the user&#8217;s GitHub profile.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin with a sample repo and found that it works as advertised and also responds nicely to various screen sizes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/contributors-screenshot.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37834]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/contributors-screenshot.jpg?resize=1025%2C616\" alt=\"contributors-screenshot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37838\" /></a></p>\n<p>If the layout looks familiar, that&#8217;s because the Acknowledge Me plugin is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores.me website</a>, which showcases folks who have contributed to the starter theme. <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores.me</a> is essentially a live demo of what this plugin does.</p>\n<p>At the moment, you cannot show contributors for a specific version, as this isn&#8217;t something that the GitHub API supports in its responses for <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-contributors\" target=\"_blank\">listing contributors</a>. The default output lists contributors to a specified repository, sorted by the number of commits per contributor in descending order.</p>\n<p>If you have a website dedicated to your project or you simply want to feature contributors in a blog post, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/acknowledge-me/\" target=\"_blank\">Acknowledge Me</a> plugin gives you an easy way to do that. You can install it via WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 23:12:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: Find Fulfilling Work\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44615\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/find-fulfilling-work/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:406:\"<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alaindebotton.com/\">Alain de Botton</a> seems to be behind this fun series of videos that tries to apply philosophy to everyday life.

The <a href=\"https://pressable.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Pressable team</a> is currently working around the clock to resolve the issues causing customer websites to go down. The status blog states: &#8220;We do not currently have and will not likely provide an ETA in this situation. The best thing to do is to keep checking the current status at the bottom of this post.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The current outage comes on the heels of <a href=\"http://pressable.com/blog/2015/01/12/sorry-downtime/\" target=\"_blank\">last week&#8217;s outage</a>, for which CEO Vid Luther apologized on the company&#8217;s blog. Some customers reported 24+ hours of downtime. Pressable has been flooded with help desk requests, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/962nadia/status/558374329683935234\" target=\"_blank\">angry</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DetailMyLife/status/558017979607420928\" target=\"_blank\">tweets</a>, and emails. For the past two weeks the company has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/montidesign/status/558256236341501952\" target=\"_blank\">hemorrhaging</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlanPerlman/status/557946518809088000\" target=\"_blank\">customers</a> faster than it can repair the servers.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Happening at Pressable?</h3>\n<p>Recent communications on the Pressable blog have left customers confused about the root of the incidents. The status <a href=\"http://status.pressable.com/2015/01/21/current-outage-breakdown-and-full-information/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> cites a litany of compounding problems, i.e. issues with caching servers, internal bandwidth limitations on database servers, limitations on the rates at which servers can be added, an isolated cluster that was causing trouble for the others, etc.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Vid Luther to get a better understanding of what is happening behind the scenes at Pressable. From the outside, it appears that the company has a lack of infrastructure to accommodate the current customer load, but Luther said it&#8217;s much more than that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The answer to this is complicated, it depends on your understanding of technology, business, and the WordPress eco-system. We are not lacking in terms of hardware or network capacity; we are short on the number of employees we have in comparison to the number of customers we have. Our entire team consists of 5 people, most people are usually amazed to learn about what we&#8217;ve accomplished as such a small team. But, when you have such a disparity in terms of employee to customer ratio, communication in a time of crisis like this suffers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Over the past several weeks, the company has had all hands on deck to fix the problems, but customers have commented on the lack of transparency and Luther&#8217;s silence during the incidents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to apologize for not having a better communication strategy. Hopefully, others can learn from this, and plan for it accordingly,&#8221; Luther told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But, having a great communication plan doesn&#8217;t work for very long, eventually, you have to fix the problem for good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is what we&#8217;ve been working on. Over the past 12 months, we&#8217;ve had issues, and we&#8217;re tired of apologizing. I thought it would be best for us to deliver the solution instead of saying sorry once again.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>A Long-Standing Problem with Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>Customers have pointed out that while their websites have gone down, the Pressable site remains in tact. &#8220;This is because our website along with several thousand others, are already in our new infrastructure,&#8221; Luther explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new infrastructure has much better underpinnings, not just from a raw horse power perspective, but it&#8217;s been designed with situations like this in mind. I would say it&#8217;s probably one of the more advanced configurations out in the WordPress hosting market.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Luther&#8217;s <a href=\"http://pressable.com/blog/2015/01/12/sorry-downtime/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> to the company blog regarding the previous outage, he mentions that the company anticipated this kind of problem last summer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fortunately, this is something that wasn’t completely unanticipated, we had identified this as a potential issue last summer, and had been working on upgrading our systems over the next two months.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What happened to halt the migration to the new infrastructure? Luther attributes it to an error in judgment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The current situation is one of several scenarios we identified last summer, and then we ranked them in order of impact to customers, and probability of it actually happening. But, as you know Murphy&#8217;s law applies to all situations and people, and it applies here. We anticipated an event like this, and we designed a solution to address it, we were so busy building the new solution, we didn&#8217;t think about putting some safe guards on the old infrastructure.  This was an error in judgement. I am to blame for it.</p>\n<p>The root of the issue here is that our old infrastructure had a very large impact radius, and we didn&#8217;t migrate people fast enough after we had identified it. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Luther recognizes that the recent outages have had an impact on the business, as many customers are looking for alternative hosting solutions. He said that the team has ideas to help mitigate the losses once the situation is stable, but they aren&#8217;t ready to share those at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First we want to make the current system stable again, then we&#8217;ll work with the affected customers and do what&#8217;s right by them,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The five-person Pressable team is currently stretched thin and working overtime. Luther encourages customers to remember that there are human beings working tirelessly behind the servers and technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re exhausted, we&#8217;ve got pregnant wives, parents who&#8217;ve suffered multiple strokes, and some of us are still reeling from a divorce, we&#8217;re human, we&#8217;re juggling too many things at once, and we know we shouldn&#8217;t be, but we don&#8217;t know how to just stop.  The tweets, the comments, and general treatment by customers and competitors has been a brutal reminder of what it is to be a human. Could we have done things diferently? Absolutely.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The hosting business and the technology and infrastructure behind it are complex. Last year, WP Engine, a much larger company that received $15 million in funding in 2014, had to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-addresses-critics-following-damaging-expose-of-its-customer-support\" target=\"_blank\">address critics following a damaging exposé of its customer support</a>. Eventually, every successful host will encounter the challenge of keeping pace with its own growth. Engineering customer happiness following unreliable service is an equally challenging endeavor.</p>\n<p>Pressable is cooking up strategies for regaining consumer confidence following the recent incidents, but the first order of business is to resolve the issues surrounding the current outage. This morning the company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pressable/status/558660979517431808\" target=\"_blank\">opened up a room on its Hipchat account</a> to add another line of communication.

The shop&#8217;s name is derived from &#8220;l’Hexagone,&#8221; which is often used to describe France&#8217;s geographical shape.</p>\n<p>Price and Bernard are aiming to make Hexagone the leading source for WordPress themes and tutorials in French. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t too many companies in this space yet, and we’re hoping a great company that’s devoted to the ideals of open-source can do well,&#8221; he said. <strong>&#8220;There&#8217;s 75 million native speakers of French and about 338 million total.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>While the vast majority of theme shops conduct business and support in English, the number of non-English speaking WordPress users is on the rise. Hexagone&#8217;s founders believe that the market is ripe for a theme shop that can provide French language-specific products, documentation, articles, and support. &#8220;If it takes off, we’d love to hire some writers and developers to work with us full-time,&#8221; Price said.</p>\n<p>Hexagone <a href=\"http://wptheming.com/2015/01/selling-products-with-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> a detailed writeup of the technologies used to build the online storefront. The site is powered by Easy Digital Downloads, Stripe, Gravity Forms, and their <a href=\"https://hexagone.io/boutique/reunion/\" target=\"_blank\">Reunion</a> theme. The article offers insight on the different types of plugins and technologies useful for selling digital products with WordPress.</p>\n<p>If Hexagone is successful, it will demonstrate that there is room in the wide world of WordPress themes for more language-niche theme shops. WordPress&#8217; continued international success depends on the ability for non-English speakers to be able to find documentation and support in their own native languages. <a href=\"https://hexagone.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Hexagone</a> is setting out to prove that the French market is ready for it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 21:49:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"Matt: Scaling PAPER for Kim\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44619\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/scaling-paper-for-kim/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:615:\"<p>I always like reading <a href=\"http://www.ftrain.com/\">Paul Ford&#8217;s writing</a>, and this one about <a href=\"https://medium.com/message/how-paper-magazines-web-engineers-scaled-kim-kardashians-back-end-sfw-6367f8d37688\">How PAPER Magazine’s web engineers scaled Kim Kardashian’s back-end (SFW)</a> is funny and accessible.

Its mission is to &#8220;develop the WordPress heroes of the world by sharing the accumulated wisdom of the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While looking for a way to give back to the WordPress community, DeRosia spoke with hundreds of people, many of whom live in different time zones around the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I began to notice a common problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many of them felt disconnected from the greater WordPress community &#8211; the Western WordPress community. For some it was a language issue, for others location, and still others simply not understanding culture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The initiative&#8217;s $60K AUD (~$48,000 USD) Kickstarter goal is intended to fund video production, branding, and marketing for DeRosia and his team to film six episodes, spotlighting WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These presentations will share the wisdom these WordPress Heroes have acquired through their successes and failures with one goal in mind: to provide information, insight, and inspiration to WordPress developers all around the world that will help them become WordPress Heroes,&#8221; DeRosia writes in the campaign description.</p>\n<p>Turning developers into &#8220;WordPress heroes&#8221; is a rather nebulous goal that may not easily catch on with the general community. However, the fact that international WordPress developers feel disconnected is a real issue that could use more attention.</p>\n<p>Many WordPress professionals who would like to attend some of the larger community events are denied visas or unable to afford the expense. Cultural misunderstandings across borders are quite common in the community, which is growing fastest in the non-English speaking world.</p>\n<p>This initiative recognizes a real problem, but the marketing and approach could use some additional refining. HeroPress has already received sharp criticism from one of WordPress&#8217; lead developers for its male-only speaker lineup and use of the term &#8220;hero:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins\">@pippinsplugins</a> unambiguous hero worship in an open source community (and of six males) doesn\'t seem like much of an achievement.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrew Nacin (@nacin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin/status/558347928977145856\">January 22, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia has a passion for mentoring people and hopes to encourage developers around the world by highlighting their work and expertise. It&#8217;s not yet clear whether video production to highlight &#8220;heroes&#8221; will resonate with the WordPress community, but the campaign has already received $8,565 AUD of its $60K goal. DeRosia has 24 days remaining to get HeroPress fully funded.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 20:07:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"WPTavern: High Risk Security Vulnerability Discovered and Patched in Pagelines and Platform Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=37702\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"http://wptavern.com/high-risk-security-vulnerability-discovered-and-patched-in-pagelines-and-platform-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3131:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pagelines.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37702]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pagelines.jpg?resize=1000%2C450\" alt=\"pagelines\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37721\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pagelines\" target=\"_blank\">PageLines</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/platform\" target=\"_blank\">Platform</a> drag-and-drop themes for WordPress have recently been patched for a privilege escalation vulnerability and a remote code execution issue discovered by Sucuri during a routine audit. Sucuri is classifying the vulnerabilities as high risk, with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD:_Risk_assessment_model\" target=\"_blank\">DREAD</a> score of 9/10, and recommends that users update their copies of the themes as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>The privilege escalation vulnerability is present in both themes, where a WordPress AJAX hook is used to modify a set of options. &#8220;Because all wp_ajax_ hooks are usable by any logged-in users (no matter what privileges they have on the target site), a subscribed user could use this hook to overwrite any options located on WordPress options database table,&#8221; Sucuri explained in the <a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/01/security-advisory-vulnerabilities-in-pagelinesplatform-theme-for-wordpress.html\" target=\"_blank\">advisory</a>.</p>\n<p>This makes it possible for an attacker to grant all new users the administrator role. However, a user&#8217;s site must be open for registration in order for this kind of attack to be successful.</p>\n<p>The free versions of these themes have been downloaded from WordPress.org more than half a million times apiece, so there are likely to be thousands of WordPress users who could potentially be affected. Fortunately, a patch is already available. The WordPress Theme Review team worked quickly to fast-track the two patched versions of the themes, so anyone who has them installed will see an update notice in the WordPress admin. Users who purchased the commercial versions will also see an update available.</p>\n<p>If you are currently unable or unwilling to update, a plugin is available that will block exploits for the legacy themes. You can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Pross/769de6e9219705041c67\">download it from GitHub</a> and install it like any other plugin if you need a quick fix to buy you time to update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To clarify, this is ONLY in legacy version of these two PageLines products (Framework and Platform),&#8221; PageLines founder Andrew Powers commented on the advisory. &#8220;Since this was first reported to us three days ago, we&#8217;ve immediately patched those files and updated them on WordPress.org, GitHub and anywhere on PageLines servers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far, Powers has no knowledge of the issue having been exploited. The fact that the danger is limited to sites with open registration should also cut down on the number of vulnerable sites. Now that the security issue is public, it&#8217;s imperative that users update immediately.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 19:07:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: New Simplenote\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44613\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/new-simplenote/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:425:\"<p><a href=\"http://simplenote.com/2015/01/21/new-simplenote-app-updates-for-ios-android-and-mac/\">New Simplenote App Updates for iOS, Android, and Mac</a>, some nice iterations. <ins datetime=\"2015-01-22T18:30:50+00:00\">Update: Simplenote for Android was <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/22/7871293/best-material-design-android-apps\">just highlighted by The Verge as one of the best Material design apps</a>.</ins></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 00:27:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: Drew Jaynes to Lead WordPress 4.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=37669\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2490:\"<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/drew-jaynes.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37669]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/drew-jaynes.jpg?resize=256%2C256\" alt=\"photo credit: 10up\" class=\"size-full wp-image-37692\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://10up.com/about/#employee-drew-jaynes\">10up</a>\n<p>WordPress 4.2 development officially kicked off today at the regularly scheduled core development meeting. Andrew Nacin announced that 10up engineer <a href=\"http://werdswords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drew Jaynes</a> will be leading the release.</p>\n<p>Jaynes, who has contributed to every major release since 3.3, recently led the initiative to create inline documentation for every hook in WordPress. He will be accompanied by Scott Taylor, who will help guide core feature plugin development for the media and image efforts that will be in motion throughout 2015.</p>\n<p>The WordPress core team is planning three releases this year. &#8220;At the moment, that looks like one in April, one in August, and one in early December,&#8221; Nacin said. He anticipates that the WP REST API will see the light of day in 4.3 or 4.4, due later this year.</p>\n<p>Jaynes opened the meeting with discussion on <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1421875969001302\" target=\"_blank\">possible candidates for features in 4.2</a>, which are likely to include <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/\" target=\"_blank\">Press This</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-theme-switcher/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Switcher</a>, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29820\" target=\"_blank\">Shiny Updates</a> (smoother installation and updating of plugins and themes). The merge deadline for feature plugins is approximately two weeks away.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to feature plugins, I&#8217;d like the general focus to be on polishing up some of our existing UIs in terms of mobile and accessibility wherever we can,&#8221; Jaynes said. &#8220;Seems like there&#8217;s tickets hanging out there we could get some wins on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A 4.1.1 maintenance release is on its way this week or possibly early next week. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-2-project-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">4.2 project schedule</a> is now updated with tentative dates for the release. The team is targeting April 8th for the official release, with the first beta planned for the week of February 25th.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 22:35:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: How to Set Up a WordPress Development Site with Codio’s Free Cloud-Based IDE\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=37626\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-set-up-a-wordpress-development-site-with-codios-free-cloud-based-ide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7395:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-new-logo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-new-logo.jpg?resize=1020%2C469\" alt=\"codio-new-logo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37640\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codio</a> is a cloud-based IDE that is primarily used in the education sector but is also available to developer professionals. The service provides instant coding environments with support for code editing and a large array of popular programming languages and software components.</p>\n<p>By making the IDE available to users through the browser, Codio eliminates the hassle that educators experience when setting up development environments for students. Projects created in Codio are accessible both in the classroom and at home, which helps students continue their learning outside of the classroom.</p>\n<p>Codio offers a <a href=\"https://codio.com/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">free account</a> that gives you 256 MB memory per project and 2 GB storage per project. Other pricing tiers cater to teachers, students, schools, universities, and professionals. However, the free account is perfect for creating a quick development site with WordPress, and you can set it up in under five minutes.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a New Project</h2>\n<p>After creating an account with Codio, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a prompt to create a new project. Click through to get started with a new project that will contain your development environment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-projects-screen.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-projects-screen.png?resize=1025%2C812\" alt=\"codio-projects-screen\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37632\" /></a></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now have the opportunity to choose from three different starting points: an empty project, a starter pack, or a GitHub import. Select &#8220;a starter pack.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-create-project.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-create-project.png?resize=1025%2C724\" alt=\"codio-create-project\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37631\" /></a></p>\n<p>This will take you to a page that lists all of Codio&#8217;s certified starter packs, which help you easily get started with technologies like Angular, Node + Express, Drupal, Ruby on Rails, and more. There are a dozen starter packs that are certified and supported by the Codio team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-starter-packs.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-starter-packs.png?resize=1025%2C724\" alt=\"codio-starter-packs\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37633\" /></a></p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a starter pack for WordPress that will automatically set up MySQL, Apache, and PHP. This makes the setup process quick and hassle-free, and you&#8217;ll be using the latest version of WordPress in just a couple minutes.</p>\n<p>After you select the WordPress starter pack, you&#8217;ll be returned to the project page. Free accounts are limited to public visibility on projects, so you may need to upgrade to the Pro plan if you require private projects.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Configure WordPress</h2>\n<p>After you complete the project setup, you&#8217;ll be dumped out onto the readme file for your project where you&#8217;ll find instructions for configuring and installing WordPress. If you&#8217;re bothered by non-capital P&#8217;s in WordPress, steady your nerves and remember that someone made this for you to use for free.</p>\n<p>Navigate to &#8220;Configure Project&#8221; in the top menu and then follow the instructions in the terminal to run the configuration script. When prompted for your password, press Enter. This is the only action you need to take during the process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-configure-project.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-configure-project.png?resize=1025%2C534\" alt=\"codio-configure-project\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37630\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Install WordPress</h2>\n<p>Once configuration is complete, navigate to &#8220;WordPress Login&#8221; in the top menu. This will take you through the normal installation process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-install.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-install.png?resize=1025%2C658\" alt=\"codio-wordpress-install\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37635\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now you should be able to log in at the following URL:</p>\n<p><code>http://theory-opera.codio.io:3000/wordpress/wp-admin/</code></p>\n<h2>Step 4: Activate the Permalink Fix &#038; Disable Canonical Redirects Pack Plugin</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re in, the last required step is to go straight to plugins and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/permalink-fix-disable-canonical-redirects-pack/\" target=\"_blank\">Permalink Fix &amp; Disable Canonical Redirects Pack</a> plugin, which you&#8217;ll find pre-installed. Visit the front end like you normally would and you&#8217;ll see your shiny new WordPress site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-frontend.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37626]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/codio-wordpress-frontend.png?resize=1025%2C569\" alt=\"codio-wordpress-frontend\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37634\" /></a></p>\n<p>The URL for your site will look something like this:</p>\n<p><code>http://theory-opera.codio.io:3000/wordpress/</code></p>\n<p>Within the Codio interface you can easily edit WordPress core, theme, and plugin files, as well as upload new files. If you have WordPress projects hosted on GitHub, you can easily import those into Codio to make changes and push those changes back to the repository.</p>\n<p>The cloud-based IDE is very similar to using <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-in-the-cloud-how-to-set-up-a-development-site-with-koding\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress on Koding</a> in many respects, and I found it equally easy to set up on both services. Both provide a quick way to do some testing, without having to set up a development environment on your local machine. If you decide to experiment and break everything, it&#8217;s safe and easy to start over. Codio&#8217;s friendly environment provides a great way to get your friends or children started with using WordPress.</p>\n<p>Since Codio was developed with educators in mind, the dashboard has a handful of helpful tutorials for learning about Git, an introduction to HTML and CSS, and an introduction Javascript. If one of your 2015 resolutions is to get started learning some technologies outside of WordPress, such as Ruby, Python, or Angular, <a href=\"https://codio.com\" target=\"_blank\">Codio</a> is a great option for getting development environments up and running so that you can start learning right away.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 21:21:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"Post Status: Let’s Grow: Introducing the Post Status Membership Club\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=7492\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://poststatus.com/lets-grow/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3982:\"<p>I&#8217;m overjoyed to share this with you.

Both memberships are annual. You pay once, and you get great stuff for a year.</p>\n<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be possible without the terrific partners that are supporting me. Each of these twelve companies has invested hard-earned money into Post Status, and I&#8217;m so thankful.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve all committed for a full year.

Some of them also have their profiles already on the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/organizations\">Organizations</a> directory as well.</p>\n<p>For those of you that register, you&#8217;ll be able to create a <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/profiles\">Profile</a> of your own. Though it might be a couple weeks before the submissions process is totally fleshed out.</p>\n<p>Profiles and organizations will also be linked from future blog posts, making finding great content and information about those within the WordPress ecosystem easier than ever.</p>\n<p>The Post Status Notes newsletter will begin Monday after PressNomics, where I&#8217;m headed today. I&#8217;ll be publishing there between now and then, but the email starts Monday. Those of you who buy a membership and login can of course see it immediately. The notes I published before today are still visible with direct links as well.</p>\n<p>The resources section is coming soon. I couldn&#8217;t squeeze everything I wanted to do into the initial launch, but I am launching on time.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a job board coming as well.</p>\n<p>Finally, most of the partners have deals that they&#8217;re going to share with members. We&#8217;ll get those gathered up and in a central spot on the member side of the site real soon.</p>\n<p>For companies that aren&#8217;t partners but want to be involved, consider the job board and the Patron memberships your opportunity to show support for the site.</p>\n<p>Thank you, everyone, for your support and for making this site possible. This is definitely an alpha version of what I want Post Status to be, but I&#8217;m so proud of what I&#8217;ve been able to make live so far, and I&#8217;m thrilled that this gets to be what I do every day.</p>\n<p>For those of you on the fence about whether this is a good value: I know what you mean. It&#8217;s a newsletter, some resources, and some deals. It&#8217;s $99.

Last year, Jarrett <a href=\"http://frankiejarrett.com/parting-ways-churchthemes-net-looking-ahead-toward-brighter-future/\" target=\"_blank\">sold ChurchThemes.net to Lift</a> co-founders Chris Wallace and Brad Miller. Since that time he has been focusing on product development for <a href=\"https://wp-stream.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Stream</a>, which has allowed him a few extra minutes to create some free extensions for WordPress.</p>\n<p>At the end of December and in early January, he released five small but highly useful plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/compact-view-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">Compact View Mode</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-session-control/\" target=\"_blank\">User Session Control</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/prevent-concurrent-logins/\" target=\"_blank\">Prevent Concurrent Logins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api-force-ssl/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON REST API Force SSL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/archived-post-status/\" target=\"_blank\">Archived Post Status</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several of his latest creations are handy for membership sites and web applications. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/archived-post-status/\" target=\"_blank\">Archived Post Status</a> caught my eye, because adds more flexibility for using WordPress as a CMS. The plugin adds a new post status that enables posts and pages to be archived. This effectively allows you to unpublish content without having to send it back to draft status.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-post-status-dropdown.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37591]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-post-status-dropdown.png?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"archived-post-status-dropdown\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37611\" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; default <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Status\" target=\"_blank\">post statuses</a> currently work very much like an on/off switch as far as a finished post is concerned. Of the eight default statuses, Published is the only one that is public, while all the rest remain behind the curtain in various states of unreadiness. None of the statuses, apart from Published, adequately indicate that a post is complete or finished.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, WordPress makes it possible for developers to register their own <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Status#Custom_Status\" target=\"_blank\">custom post statuses</a>, which is what Jarrett did with this plugin. He created it for sites where content is not always meant to be evergreen. It allows you to archive posts in the same way that you might archive email.</p>\n<p>Archived Post Status is compatible with posts, pages, and custom post types, giving you a wide array of possible use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Archive pages or posts from a conference or event for editing and re-use next year</li>\n<li>Archive real estate listings for records</li>\n<li>Cycle portfolio content in and out of the site as necessary</li>\n<li>Temporarily remove listings from a site that indexes businesses or organizations</li>\n<li>Archive products to bring back for future use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While custom post types seem to be one of the most likely uses for this plugin, you may not want to have the archived status available to all post types. Jarrett includes a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/archived-post-status/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">filter</a> that allows you to exclude the Archived status from appearing on certain post types.</p>\n<p>Some might be wondering why you wouldn&#8217;t use the Draft status, since the Archived post status essentially puts a post in the same state. To use drafts in this way would be to split its purpose into multiple uses, which are not clearly separated when sorting. If you are looking for previously published content that is complete, while hunting through all drafts in progress, you have to be fully knowledgeable of all the content on the site and use your memory to do the sorting. The archived status keeps everything nicely sorted for future use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-posts-list-screen.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37591]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/archived-posts-list-screen.png?resize=600%2C400\" alt=\"archived-posts-list-screen\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37614\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you need a non-public archive of completed posts, this simple plugin will do the trick.

Sullivan shares details behind the attack, how it affected the bottom line, and says it was someone in the WordPress community who orchestrated the attack.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using some sophisticated techniques we were able to trace back to the source of the spam attack and unfortunately found out that the attack was started by someone within the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>They did everything through a third-party, an internet hitman of sorts, to try to cover their tracks, but they weren’t quite careful enough and we were able to uncover where everything started.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Instead of naming the individual, Sullivan left a message aimed specifically at the person responsible, &#8220;The only reason I even mention it is so that hopefully, that person reads this, and knows that what they’re doing is impacting the livelihood’s of people and their families.&#8221; It&#8217;s this message which has me wondering, is it time to name and shame people in the WordPress community?</p>\n<h2>The Good</h2>\n<p>In my experience, the community rarely calls people out, even if they have <a title=\"http://womenofwp.org/2014/01/how-to-report-harassment-at-wordcamps/\" href=\"http://womenofwp.org/2014/01/how-to-report-harassment-at-wordcamps/\">routinely harassed others</a> at a WordCamp. Instead, we usually find out about them through back channels. By calling people out, it warns others and makes everyone aware of the situation.</p>\n<h2>The Bad</h2>\n<p>Naming and shaming creates the potential for libel and defamation lawsuits. The internet has a long memory and if a person changes for the better, it will be hard to forget mistakes made in the past. It could hurt future employment opportunities as employers do background checks using Google. There&#8217;s likely a lot of unintended consequences as well.</p>\n<h2>Judge and Jury</h2>\n<p>I doubt the community will start calling people out, as it creates anger, grief, and drama. Besides, who are we to act as judge and jury? However, it bothers me to know that an unnamed person is negatively impacting the livelihood of WordPress businesses and people.</p>\n<p>On one hand, I want to see the individual dealt with in the public sphere and turned into an example. On the other, I feel it&#8217;s probably not the best way to go about it. Maybe the system already in place is the best way to handle these types of situations?

Each year, the event donates a portion of its proceeds to <a href=\"http://www.stjude.org\">St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital</a>. Pagely Co-founder, Joshua Strebel, says the decision to donate to St. Jude was made long before he and his wife had kids, &#8220;St Jude has been our charity of choice for many years. Even before Sally and I had kids, we were touched by those commercials that showed the kids fighting cancer. I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot for kids, coming from a large family. Of all the charities you could give to, St. Jude is a no brainer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since 2012, the event has donated over $11K to St. Jude Hospital and Strebel says funding from PressNomics 3 this year will allow them to donate over $10K to a <em>charity yet to be named</em>. &#8220;After PressNomics 1, we donated a little over $5K and there was an anonymous matching donation. After PressNomics 2, we donated a little over $6K. This year the budget has allowed us to donate just over $10K.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>DonorsChoose.org</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DonorsChooseImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37461]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37501\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DonorsChooseImage.png?resize=1025%2C527\" alt=\"DonorsChoose\" /></a><br />\nWhen I reached out to the community to figure out who gives to charities, I discovered a number of people who use <a title=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/\" href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/\">DonorsChoose</a>. DonorsChoose is an organization that makes it easy to help classrooms in need. Public school teachers post classroom project requests, which range from pencils for poetry to microscopes for mitochondria-organization.</p>\n<p><a title=\"https://eamann.com/\" href=\"https://eamann.com/\">Eric Mann</a>, who contributes to the organization, had a lot of friends in college who majored in education and went on to become teachers. He discovered that many of them worked in schools with small budgets and limited supplies. He explains why he uses DonorsChoose.org.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I use DonorsChoose.org to help fund the purchase of books for classroom lessons, field trips to museums and science exhibits, and modern laptop computers for technical education. Many of the teachers I sponsor are working in low-income areas with at-risk youth and don&#8217;t have the tools available to make much of a difference without community sponsorship.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mann believes investing in education is one of the best long-term investments you can make, &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to spend money on this Kickstarter or that IndieGoGo when you get a tangible (or digital) return on the investment. Spending money to help protect and shepherd the education of today&#8217;s youth, though, returns an investment in better educated leaders, educators, and technologists for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>WP Site Care</h2>\n<p>WordPress support agency, <a title=\"http://www.wpsitecare.com\" href=\"http://www.wpsitecare.com\">WP Site Care</a>, contributed to <a title=\"http://www.wpsitecare.com/5-minutes-reflection-look-back-2014/\" href=\"http://www.wpsitecare.com/5-minutes-reflection-look-back-2014/\">several different organizations and initiatives</a> throughout 2014.

We found out about a number of causes from the WordPress community itself. For example, funding treatment for autism is something that has a personal impact on a few of us at WP Site Care.</p>\n<p>We like to make sure that the causes that are important to individuals become important for all of us collectively. It not only goes to help the causes themselves, but helps us get closer as a working family.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Individuals Who Received Financial Assistance From The WordPress Community</h2>\n<p><strong>Just Tadlock</strong> &#8211; Near the end of 2013, Justin Tadlock <a title=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/12/17/help-me-get-a-house-for-christmas\" href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/12/17/help-me-get-a-house-for-christmas\">discovered the perfect house</a>, but he didn&#8217;t have the money to cover closing costs, quarterly taxes, and appliances. He requested $5K to cover his costs, but he ended up receiving over $7K. It&#8217;s important to note that the campaign took place around Christmas which is a tough time financially for a number of people. However, the community rallied together to give Tadlock the ultimate Christmas gift.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan Griffiths</strong> &#8211; Dan Griffiths, who is known on Twitter as <a title=\"https://twitter.com/ghost1227\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ghost1227\">Ghost1227</a> and one of the creators of <a title=\"http://wptally.com/\" href=\"http://wptally.com/\">WP Tally,</a> recently found himself in a financial emergency.

Happy Joe founder, James Dalman, published an all points bulletin on Twitter asking for help from the WordPress community. Within <strong>two hours</strong> of the initial call for help, Griffiths reached his goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Kim Parsell&#8217;s Son</strong> &#8211; Kim Parsell&#8217;s son was about to begin a new job when tragically, his <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away\">mother passed away</a>. He wasn&#8217;t able to start the job, putting him in a financial bind. He <a title=\"http://www.gofundme.com/wpmom\" href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/wpmom\">created a campaign</a> asking for $1K to help pay bills as he mourned the loss of his mother. Within 42 minutes, 8 people raised $760 of the requested $1,000. When it was all said and done, 33 people raised $2K.</p>\n<p><strong>John James Jacoby</strong> &#8211; In late 2014, John James Jacoby <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-launches-indiegogo-campaign-to-fund-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development\">launched a crowdfunding campaign</a> asking for $50K in order to work on BuddyPress, GlotPress, and bbPress full-time for 6 months.

Petrova, a marketing expert and long-time food blogger, is a member of both the WordPress community and the larger tech community in Bulgaria. She has also worked as an organizer for many local technical conferences over the years.</p>\n<p>Her motivation to address the widespread problem of depression in IT grew out of personal experiences with friends and co-workers who were struggling with it. This put her on the path to research the disease and find ways to raise awareness on the topic. I had the opportunity to interview Petrova after the event, and it&#8217;s easy to see why she is a person to whom people would come for advice. Her warm, empathetic personality is combined with a rare willingness to listen to others.</p>\n<p>Petrova&#8217;s experience in food blogging gives her a format for talking about depression in a way that people can understand, which helps to mitigate the stigma that surrounds the issue. We&#8217;ll take a look at some of the recipes she shared in her presentation, but first it&#8217;s important to have a basic understanding of depression.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Depression</h2>\n<p>Nearly everyone knows someone who is suffering from depression, as it afflicts more than <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/\" target=\"_blank\">350 million people</a> of all ages worldwide and is the leading cause of disability. In the most extreme cases it can lead to suicide.</p>\n<p>Clinical depression is the most severe form, which is often treated with psychological and pharmacological therapies. However, many more people suffer from milder forms of depression from time to time.</p>\n<p>In his TED talk, titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBUcBfkVCo\" target=\"_blank\">Depression, The Secret We Share</a>, writer Andrew Solomon said, <strong>&#8220;The opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality.&#8221;</strong> He describes his own dark journey of struggling with depression, which he noticed when all the normal activities of life and work began to seem like too much.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it&#8217;s ridiculous. You know it&#8217;s ridiculous while you&#8217;re experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages, and eat lunch, and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door, and that it&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>\n<p>And yet you are in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity, and then the anxiety set in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Solomon notes that people tend to confuse depression, grief, and sadness, but understanding the trajectory and duration of these feelings will help to clarify the situation. While grief is explicitly reactive and related to loss, depression doesn&#8217;t always have an easily identifiable cause. Some forms of depression will require professional help for the person to regain a semblance of normal living.</p>\n<h2>Sources or Triggers of Depression in IT</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/emergency.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37466]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/emergency.jpg?resize=1024%2C482\" alt=\"photo credit: Code & Martini by Ivana Vasilj - cc license\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21873\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/dLUWMb\">Code &#038; Martini</a> by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivanavasilj/\">Ivana Vasilj</a> &#8211; cc license\n<p>Depression in the IT industry can be more difficult to address, as many tech workers are intelligent, independent, and in high demand. Three years ago, when Yana Petrova and her colleague first proposed a presentation on depression for a local tech conference, she experienced a great deal of resistance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There were a lot of discussions surrounding it and people in the organizations were hesitant to include it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They believed that people who are in IT are earning very well, the people who are suffering should just go to the doctor, there&#8217;s no need to discuss it at a technical conference.&#8221; The presentation was so impactful, however, that some of the top Bulgarian psychologists heard about it and encouraged them to continue raising awareness.</p>\n<p>The IT industry has several unique factors that seem to contribute to depression and anxiety. Many people in the WordPress community, in particular, work alone at home as freelancers or with distributed companies. Unless the individual is motivated, this work environment can severely limit healthy social interactions. Additional pressures can also lead to periods of depression, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client work and relationships</li>\n<li>Pressure to always be connected</li>\n<li>Interaction with the larger development community</li>\n<li>An industry emphasis on high competency forces workers to continue building skills on top of ever-changing technologies, while also completing daily work</li>\n<li>Not understanding the limits of your body/emotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I think that most of the time they are trying to become really good at what they are doing, which requires most of their attention and most of their time,&#8221; Petrova said, commenting on the lifestyle of many developers with whom she is connected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you are reading code, coding most of your time, and doing things related to coding, then a social part is missing &#8211; the part related to relationships, self-esteem, knowing yourself. You&#8217;re just not going deeper into that, because you are giving your time and attention to something else, trying to be good at something else. Our brain resources are kind of limited.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Client interaction is also a major cause of stress and anxiety for self-employed professionals. When you work from home by yourself without a team, criticism from clients can have a severe impact on your feelings of self-worth. If you don&#8217;t have a healthy reservoir of outside interests and hobbies, you can easily become mired in client negativity.</p>\n<p>During Petrova&#8217;s presentation at WordCamp Europe, she received questions about how to deal with clients who can damage a developer&#8217;s self-confidence. Sometimes clients don&#8217;t understand that they are not working with machines but rather real people with families and lives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because a lot of people are working from home, what the client thinks and what the community thinks about their work can be a source of depression,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, a lot of people have mentioned that clients are sometimes rude in explaining how incompetent they were.&#8221; This can have a devastating impact on a developer who is lacking self-confidence, outside social connections, and restorative hobbies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Questions about clients wasn&#8217;t something I expected, but it&#8217;s another vertical to explore,&#8221; Petrova said. It has inspired her to start working on a talk about relationships, clients, teams, and how to preserve your team.</p>\n<p>Petrova has observed that many people working in IT don&#8217;t prioritize knowing themselves and understanding their reactions, although this is not unique to the IT industry. They are often blind to their mental health issues and don&#8217;t know when to seek help.</p>\n<h2>Tips for Dealing with Depression and Anxiety</h2>\n<p>Petrova&#8217;s presentation centered around ways to prevent depression and successfully cope with work-related stress and anxiety. &#8220;Depression is not something that defines you for a lifetime,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It might be just a problem, and it might be that, at this time, happiness requires more effort for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She believes that depression is an important mechanism in the human consciousness. &#8220;It&#8217;s a signal for us that change is necessary &#8211; changes about us or changes somewhere around us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Petrova compares cooking recipes to recipes for coping with depression, noting that it&#8217;s important to adapt those recipes to work with your preferences and needs. Her presentation highlights five ways that you can discover and create your own recipes for preventing depression from setting in.</p>\n<h4>1. Take deep breaths.</h4>\n<p>Deep breathing practices help you to regain calmness and perspective. &#8220;They say that graveyards are full of irreplaceable people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Actually, we all are, but it&#8217;s more important that we are alive, we are here, and we are happy. We can never control everything in the world, and we should never try to take responsibility for all the things here. We often tend to forget that our bodies have their limits and we are fragile.&#8221; Deep breathing reminds us that we are not machines.</p>\n<p>In addition to breathing, Petrova suggests finding other activities outside of work that will help you to gain perspective on life. &#8220;Dedicate special time for your recipes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Start spending an hour in the morning with your coffee. Spend Sunday afternoon with someone or with friends,&#8221; she suggests.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;But never give away this time. Never give it away for work. Never replace it for something, never sacrifice it. It&#8217;s important that you keep this thing and slow down.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<h4>2. Make lists.</h4>\n<p>Petrova advises people to make lists of recipes that work for them in preparation for moments when it&#8217;s difficult to think clearly. &#8220;Think of those lists as emergency plans. When the grey veil of depression comes, your rituals may not seem as important or as life-saving as the day before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You might not enjoy them as you did before, so you should have a list of things.&#8221; Perhaps it&#8217;s a list of movies you wanted watch, or places you wanted to visit, a restaurant or recipe you wanted to try.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the beginning you won&#8217;t be willing to do anything from this list. Those things will look silly and you say no this is not the time to do this. You will be preoccupied with all of your worries right now. Force yourself and just pick a thing and start doing it. Start those lists today and obey them frequently.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Petrova shared a few simple items on her own list &#8211; i.e. eating avocados, making herself a chai latte, enjoying a local spicy soup. If you maintain a clear list of things that make you feel better, you have some activities to turn to when things start to become stressful at work.</p>\n<h4>3. Provide small wins.</h4>\n<p>Make goals for yourself that put you on the path to success with frequent, small milestones. This will help to keep you oriented towards fulfillment. &#8220;Another recipe of mine was to keep an editorial calendar,&#8221; Petrova said. &#8220;Even if I am not feeling well, I already had something planned, so I can keep moving in that direction.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>4. Think about your thinking.</h4>\n<p>People who excel at solving some of tech&#8217;s most complex problems can also be notoriously masterful at avoiding introspection. Petrova approaches the topic of introspection with the idea of &#8220;debugging yourself,&#8221; a concept with which many in tech are familiar.</p>\n<p>She suggests writing your own user manual to document how you work and what keeps you healthy. &#8220;Write your own user manual. Start writing a user manual for yourself and imagine you are giving it to someone else. This will help you think more about how you are thinking,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can see that there are a lot of small hacks that can help you feel better. Just imagine how empowering it might be to discover more,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This requires a lot of patience and dedication. It usually takes time for reading and time for writing. It takes time to debug your mind.&#8221; Petrova suggests writing down all of the things that help your mind work better so that you have that manual for when depression tries to settle in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Debug yourself, but if you can&#8217;t do it yourself, then try to talk to someone,&#8221; Petrova said. &#8220;We cannot resolve anything by ourselves.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>5. Learn to listen, learn to share.</h4>\n<p>You can never underestimate the importance of community in maintaining your mental health. The community is stronger when people overcome their irrational inhibitions and learn to share their stories and listen to each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really easy to listen the proper way, but you can sometimes save people by listening to them carefully,&#8221; Petrova said. &#8220;You can empower them by listening to them.</p>\n<p>People need to tell their stories to realize what is happening. Sometimes when you are keeping things only in your head, you are not realizing the power of your situation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When should depression lead you to seek professional help? &#8220;In some official resources, they say if you are feeling like this for four weeks then go find some help,&#8221; Petrova said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I think that the more you are getting to know yourself, the more you can feel if you need to meet with someone or talk with someone. The doctor might not be the first person. The first person might be a friend or a relative or someone who is closer to you. Or just someone you see, someone you believe in and decide to tell your story to. I really believe that it&#8217;s powerful to tell stories.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Staying Healthy and Preventing Depression</h2>\n<p>Petrova recommends a book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Healthy-Programmer-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1937785319\" target=\"_blank\">The Healthy Programmer</a>, which contains the basics of healthy living for people who work most of the time in a seated position. She believes that movement is especially important for those who work from home and set their own schedules.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first thing is related to moving/movement. Are you moving enough? Are you doing active things, sports? This is really important, because if you are living where you are working, then you can find yourself in a situation where you are staying home, ordering food all the time. You forget all the healthy things you could do to feel better, for your body to feel better and your mind to work well. It&#8217;s really related.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re staying active and able to use your normal problem-solving skills to debug yourself, you will greatly lessen the chances of falling into depression. Building up these habits takes time, but you&#8217;re also less likely to be crippled by stress and anxiety. In the future, Petrova plans to start a blog called &#8220;The Happiness Cookbook&#8221; in order to encourage people to share their recipes with the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Get to know yourself better and your reactions to different situations,&#8221; Petrova advises. &#8220;You really need a lot of time to know what&#8217;s happening to you and to know how to react in a timely way for prevention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We all have our stressful moments. We all have our sad moments. You are certain to have them in your lifetime. But you can learn how to prevent your reactions, what to do when depression happens, and the best way to overcome it. The temporary feelings can be over at some point with the help of simple tips, and then you are not going to get depressed. Otherwise, you are just digging into that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Obviously, there are some forms of depression that will ultimately require professional help. Petrova&#8217;s tips for prevention are intended to help folks before they reach a very dark place where they have lost interest in work completely and are struggling to find vitality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Depression means that you need to change something, for yourself, around yourself, about yourself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is the key message. Just research the pain that made you feel like this and start debugging it step by step.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 22:39:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: Pope Francis on Climate Change\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44598\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://ma.tt/2015/01/pope-francis-on-climate-change/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:718:\"<blockquote><p>He has been called the “superman pope”, and it would be hard to deny that Pope Francis has had a good December.

When I write content, I often hit the preview button several times to review changes. This results in DFW mode turning on and off multiple times which I find distracting and at times, annoying. I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way as Brian Krogsgard of <a title=\"https://poststatus.com/distraction-free-writing-wordpress/\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/distraction-free-writing-wordpress/\">PostStatus.com explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I write, I tend to save and preview the post live a number of times while I’m writing, especially toward the end of my time spent writing.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit dizzying to be fixing typos and saving and previewing while going in an out of DFW.</p>\n<p>I’d like to see “Save Draft” and “Preview” buttons moved into the editor body, so that I can stay in DFW while finishing up my posts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the idea of moving the Save Draft and Preview buttons to the post editor. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-preview-posts-in-distraction-free-writing-mode-without-seeing-a-transition\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-preview-posts-in-distraction-free-writing-mode-without-seeing-a-transition\">I reviewed</a> the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-preview-button/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fullscreen-preview-button/\">Distraction Free Preview Button</a> plugin by Alex King. Krogsgard also lists several other ideas with screenshots showing the changes in action, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inverted editor colors</li>\n<li>Centered post editor</li>\n<li>Setting the editor to use the Max-width available</li>\n<li>Full-height editor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jen Mylo, who reviewed the feature as a user, <a title=\"http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/\" href=\"http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/\">suggests</a> similar improvements. One other thing I&#8217;d like to see is a full-height editor. It&#8217;s annoying when the meta boxes fade away, the editor remains the same size as if the boxes are still in place.

It changed from a <em>you have to toggle to it every time</em> feature to <em>it&#8217;s always on feature</em> in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>With that change, the DFW experience changed to be more like the regular editor, well, because it is the regular editor. It just removes stuff off of the screen that you&#8217;re not using.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the editor now, with DFW not on:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7393\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-1-post-editor.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-7393 size-large\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4-1-post-editor-752x473.png\" alt=\"4-1-post-editor\" width=\"752\" height=\"473\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The WordPress post editor, as of WordPress 4.1 (with custom admin theme colors)</p></div>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the editor now, with DFW on:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7390\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-wp-4-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-7390 size-large\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-wp-4-1-752x442.png\" alt=\"dfw-wp-4-1\" width=\"752\" height=\"442\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">DFW mode as of WordPress 4.1</p></div>\n<p>Jen Mylo wrote a post about how <a href=\"http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/\">she doesn&#8217;t like the new feature as much as the old one</a>. I&#8217;ve seen similar complaints a few times from folks.</p>\n<p>The positive trade-off is that now DFW is much more likely to be used, since the setting (the four-arrow icon in the upper right corner of the editor box) is persistent for a user once enabled. Previously, DFW had to be toggled in each use, and was probably used by a minority of users.</p>\n<p>4.1 was the first go at the feature in its new state, and I think it&#8217;s pretty great. I&#8217;m now using DFW every post I write, whereas before I almost always forgot to turn it on; plus, it previously felt like a commitment to the blog post.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I think Jen&#8217;s critique (as well as others&#8217;) are noteworthy, so I decided to take some of the complaints I&#8217;ve heard and hack around in the browser inspector to see if I could alleviate them.</p>\n<p>One thing Jen brought up was the height of the editor box. You no longer toggle the height from the bottom corner; instead it auto-adjusts with your content, and comes shipped with a default height.</p>\n<h3>Full-height editor box</h3>\n<p>She believes, and I agree, that it would be nice if the editor filled the available height of the window, because right now it feels a bit squished and cramped. Thankfully, we have the viewport height (vh) unit in CSS, and this can be adjusted with pure CSS and a few media queries.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7391\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-4-1-full-height.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-7391 size-large\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-4-1-full-height-752x451.png\" alt=\"dfw-4-1-full-height\" width=\"752\" height=\"451\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress DFW mode with full-height content area</p></div>\n<p>I think this is a progressive feature, so I&#8217;d be for using the vh CSS unit not using Javascript on this, despite the not-great browser support in IE.</p>\n<p>In fact, I really like this concept, even when not in DFW mode. It really calms me down, not seeing the metaboxes below the post content right out of the gate. We can just keep them right below the editor, just out of sight.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7392\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post-editor-full-height.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7392\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/post-editor-full-height-752x451.png\" alt=\"WordPress post editor with full height content area\" width=\"752\" height=\"451\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress post editor with full height content area</p></div>\n<h3>Centered editor in DFW</h3>\n<p>Another note Jen made was that she was bothered the editor isn&#8217;t centered in DFW mode. Well, I&#8217;ve never noticed that, but <em>now I do, ugh</em>. <img src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> It&#8217;s this way because DFW simply hides the right column and admin columns, which are not the same width, and therefore the editor is left with unequal margins.</p>\n<p>Well, during the transition of those admin columns, theoretically, we could also move the editor box, though I think we should test what kind of UX effect there is of transitioning the editor your cursor is in. It might not be the most elegant solution.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, here&#8217;s what it&#8217;d look like once you&#8217;re done, including the full-height editor box.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7394\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-full-height-and-centered.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7394\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-full-height-and-centered-752x471.png\" alt=\"DFW full-height editor and centered\" width=\"752\" height=\"471\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">DFW full-height editor and centered</p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m iffy on this one. I really don&#8217;t like the idea of moving the box you&#8217;re actively focusing on. Needs testing.</p>\n<h3>Max-width on the editor box</h3>\n<p>A critique I learned from another user was that the huge width on the DFW editor box bothered them. I agree. I think we should put a max-width on the editor box &#8212; probably whether the user is in DFW mode or not.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the large version that&#8217;s unwieldy, especially in DFW mode:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7400\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-max-width.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7400\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-max-width-752x285.png\" alt=\"We should not let this get so wide. Line length matters!\" width=\"752\" height=\"285\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We should not let this get so wide. Line length matters!</p></div>\n<h3>Inverted editor colors, with centered content box</h3>\n<p>One more idea: what if we inverted the WordPress admin colors, so that the background was white, and metaboxes were gray. And then, we could ditch the &#8220;container&#8221; of the editor box altogether.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a mockup of that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7402\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-white-admin-background.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7402\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/all-white-admin-background-752x431.jpg\" alt=\"All white background, with centered editor\" width=\"752\" height=\"431\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">All white background, with centered editor</p></div>\n<p>I think this could look really nice, but it would require a good bit of admin changes.</p>\n<p>And then the Distraction-Free Writing version:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-all-white.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7404\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-all-white-752x432.jpg\" alt=\"dfw-all-white\" width=\"752\" height=\"432\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Save and Preview inline</h3>\n<p>This one is my own idea, based on drafting posts in this mode every day.</p>\n<p>Distraction-Free Writing toggles on and off pretty rapidly as you focus in and out of the editor. When I write, I tend to save and preview the post live a number of times while I&#8217;m writing, especially toward the end of my time spent writing.</p>\n<p>It gets a bit dizzying to be fixing typos and saving and previewing while going in an out of DFW.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see &#8220;Save Draft&#8221; and &#8220;Preview&#8221; buttons moved into the editor body, so that I can stay in DFW while finishing up my posts. Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7389\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-inline-save-preview.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7389\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dfw-inline-save-preview-752x473.jpg\" alt=\"DFW with Save and Preview inline\" width=\"752\" height=\"473\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">DFW with Save and Preview inline</p></div>\n<h3>Iteration is important</h3>\n<p>Iteration in WordPress feature development is important. I&#8217;m glad we introduced Distraction-Free Writing in the first place, and I think the changes in 4.1 are worthy. They may need some adjustments, but it&#8217;s a process that will continue to improve.</p>\n<p>Constructive feedback is always good. The more we use and figure out how others are using various features of WordPress, the more they can be improved.</p>\n<p>In preparing to write this post, I was able to reach out in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/planet/feed/slack.wordpress.org\">WordPress Slack</a> and find out the best venue to give feedback, and if Jen&#8217;s post and this one help start a conversation, the changes can make their way to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">Trac tickets</a> and eventual patches to make WordPress better.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen at least a handful of folks say &#8220;Bring the old Distraction-Free Writing back!&#8221; That&#8217;s understandable; lots of folks don&#8217;t like change. Every UI-involved feature in WordPress ever has had critics.</p>\n<p>But when you look at WordPress today and WordPress 5 or more years ago, WordPress today is way more beautiful to use. That&#8217;s because the experience the core team has built has iterated over time in response to use, feedback, and contributions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 18:01:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"Jen Mylo: Distraction-free Writing Mode\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"http://jenmylo.com/?p=4787\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://jenmylo.com/2015/01/17/distraction-free-writing-mode/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6729:\"<p>Once upon a time in WordPress there was a New Feature called Distraction-free writing mode. You accessed it by clicking the icon in the editor toolbar that means <em>full screen</em> pretty much everywhere on the web.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4788\" src=\"https://jenmylo.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dfw-icon-highlight.png?w=520&h=71\" alt=\"post editor toolbar\" width=\"520\" height=\"71\" /></p>\n<p>It would load a new screen tha mostly just consisted of a writing box not surrounded by meta boxes or formatting, and what limited formatting options there were would only appear when you moused out of the writing area. It wasn&#8217;t perfect (I would have liked that fading toolbar to have all the same formatting options as the regular editor) but it <em>was</em> pretty non-distracting, and it just felt calm.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4790\" src=\"https://jenmylo.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dfw-ui.png?w=520\" alt=\"old distraction-free writing interface\" /></p>\n<p>A while back I noticed some changes in the wp-admin regular editor. All the navigation and meta boxes now faded away while you were writing, and I thought, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s pretty nice, kind of a DFW Lite!&#8221; I didn&#8217;t pay too much attention, as I was just writing a quick post, but in my head I approved, and thought it was a good improvement. Until this morning.</p>\n<p>Most of my blog-based activity happens on work-related blogs that have front-end posting forms, so it&#8217;s been a while since I tried to access DFW mode. But I was going to be writing a long post, and I wanted to go over into that peaceful screen, so I clicked on the full-screen icon. That&#8217;s when I discovered that what I thought was DFW Lite was actually the new DFW. There was no more new screen.</p>\n<p>At first I thought,&#8221;Hm, that&#8217;s a lot more efficient. Good for them!&#8221; Then I started writing, and thought, &#8220;[Letters-in-a-configuration-to-replicate-my-slightly-alarmed-and-uncomfortable-sound]!&#8221; I hated to admit it, but I felt physically uncomfortable. Am I turning into Sheldon (<a title=\"Video from Big Bang Theory\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynUfxitGpfU\">skip to 3:34</a>)? Crap! Anyway, here&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t love the new DFW.</p>\n<p>When wp core switched over to the &#8220;toolbar anchors to top of editor no matter how long your post&#8221; setup, users lost the ability to grab a corner of the editor and drag it to make it taller. Since it is supposed to automatically resize as you write, most people thought this was a tradeoff with a net benefit, and even though I really didn&#8217;t want to lose my little corner resize handle, I agreed that the net benefit was worth it. The thing is, if in your head you&#8217;ve already thought out a long post, starting in the small box feels cramped, kind of like when you have to repack a sleeping bag and you&#8217;re smooshing it with all your might to get it to fit back into the compact stuff sack.</p>\n<p>Think about opening a New Document in MS Word (or equivalent writing program) , or a writer putting a fresh piece of paper in the typewriter (for those who are too young to remember, <a title=\"Video of someone putting paper into a typewriter\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkUXn5bOwzk\">it&#8217;s like this</a>). There have been reams written by famous authors in the past about the feeling that action engenders &#8212; a feeling of limitless possibilities, a knock on the creative door, an open road ahead. That&#8217;s what DFW tried to emulate. Starting in the small box instead of the full height box feels like possibilities with limits, a creative window that won&#8217;t open more than 3 inches for safety, a road with one lane closed for construction. Thoughts scrunch down to try to fit into the available space.</p>\n<p>Even when the box expands to be the height of the screen (minus padding against top and bottom of browser), a chunk of space is lost at the top for the toolbar. That fade it used to have really did remove distraction. I wish there had been a way to combine the zen of the fade away (Matt&#8217;s original nickname for DFW was zen mode) with the convenience of the always-at-top placement.</p>\n<p>In the old DFW, the writing window really did have that feeling of a fresh New Document or crisp new sheet of paper. Now, even once it&#8217;s tall, it&#8217;s a bit off-center to the left, because that&#8217;s where the editor box is when on a screen containing navigation and metaboxes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4798\" src=\"https://jenmylo.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-17-at-7-54-33-am.png?w=520&h=313\" alt=\"Screenshot of current distraction-free mode\" width=\"520\" height=\"313\" /></p>\n<p>There was a time (pre-2000) when I didn&#8217;t think too much about alignment in UIs. Then I got a lot of design ideas drilled into my head that stuck, especially regarding alignment. I like asymmetry in a lot of things, always have. Hell, in a site we were just working on one of the things we said we wanted was some asymmetry. But for DFW, the symmetry &#8212; the centeredness &#8212; was a big part of what made that screen so calming. Your brain didn&#8217;t have to do any pattern recognition or internal balancing to make it feel right. But now it skews to the left and it&#8217;s driving me crazy, Sheldon style. This isn&#8217;t zen for me; it&#8217;s a misused apostrophe, a lowercase p, a cabinet door left open.</p>\n<p>I thought I&#8217;d be a holdout forever against using the new <a title=\"wordpress.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.com\">wordpress.com</a> posting interface (I have a lot of issues with it, surprise), but, well, their DFW has that open and symmetrical feeling (even if it has other problems) that makes for a non-Sheldony writing experience.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4789\" src=\"https://jenmylo.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-17-at-7-27-45-am.png?w=520&h=378\" alt=\"Screenshot of distraction-free writing mode on wordpress.com\" width=\"520\" height=\"378\" /></p>\n<p>So this might be my last post written in wp-admin DFW mode for now.

When SIDEKICK Co-founder, Ben Fox, showed off the initial demo last year, I described it as the <a title=\"http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html\" href=\"http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html\">Camtasia</a> of WordPress.</p>\n<p>SIDEKICK has a <a title=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/plans/create_wp_walkthroughs/\" href=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/plans/create_wp_walkthroughs/\">couple different plans</a> available depending upon how many walkthroughs you want to publish. The free account allows for three <strong>published</strong> walkthroughs, 50 monthly plays or views, 1 active website, and support for WordPress multi-site.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SideKickActivated.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37315]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-37429\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SideKickActivated.png?resize=1025%2C501\" alt=\"SIDEKICK Activated\" /></a>SIDEKICK Activated\n<p>The walkthrough creation interface is similar to Camtasia in that it has a timeline with various steps that can be added. To supply audio, you need to upload a pre-recorded mp3 file for each step. While not as easy as recording the audio within the plugin, it&#8217;s easier to fix mishaps without having to redo the entire walkthrough.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WalkthroughInterface.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37315]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-37432\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WalkthroughInterface.png?resize=1025%2C280\" alt=\"Walkthrough Interface\" /></a>Walkthrough Interface\n<h2>It&#8217;s Clearly The First Version</h2>\n<p>While testing SIDEKICK, I encountered several things that need to be addressed in future versions. <del>During the initial setup, there is a box that explains how to build your own walkthrough with a link to get Composer. This leads me to believe that it&#8217;s a separate product or plugin when in reality, it&#8217;s not. Composer is part of SIDEKICK out of the box.</del> <em><strong>Update</strong></em> SIDEKICK has already released an update that fixes the copy.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/getcomposerbox.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[37315]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-37433\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/getcomposerbox.png?resize=610%2C207\" alt=\"Get Composer Information Box\" /></a>Old Get Composer Information Box\n<p>I encountered a few links which point to a 404 page, like their <a title=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/terms-of-use/\" href=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/terms-of-use/\">Terms of Use</a>. With so many steps in the setup process, it would be nice if SIDEKICK had a walkthrough of its own, to guide users on how to configure it. Despite these minor setbacks, they don&#8217;t detract from its usefulness. Fox says, the team is already aware of the issues and over the next few weeks, will release several updates.</p>\n<p>It took awhile, but once I understood how it works, I found creating walkthroughs a fairly easy process. With version one out the door, it will be interesting to see how it&#8217;s adopted by theme and plugin developers, considering a number of them already use <a title=\"http://theme.fm/2011/09/introducing-pointers-in-wordpress-3-3-2407/\" href=\"http://theme.fm/2011/09/introducing-pointers-in-wordpress-3-3-2407/\">admin pointers</a> that are built into WordPress.

If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire price of all bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction price with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were priced at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013. If Bitcoin could grab even 1% of the market, then the price will should go up much higher than it is.\r\n\r\nFor large organizations or individuals that want to trade a billion or more dollars worth of bitcoins, then they would either have to buy about a quarter of all bitcoins in circulation at the current rate. If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.\r\n\r\nWith the liquidity of bitcoins and the continued mining, I\'m not sure it is going to skyrocket too high. Most companies just sell the bitcoins as soon as they receive them. Maybe that will change if the price keeps going up, but it is too much of a gamble for a large company to hold onto the bitcoins unless if they have plenty of cash reserves to cover the potential drop in the price of bitcoins. I think the cost to mine will stay aligned with the price because why would someone pay more for bitcoins when they can pay less to mine them and the other way around, so the two should stay pretty close together. And, there is only so much hashing power being created every month so the price could surge more in the short while hashing power surges will be more long-term.\r\n\r\nAnd, the blockchain tech is really about proof of existence - a hash of a document can be stored on the blockchain to prove that it existed at a certain time. The more valuable the documents that get put on the blockchain, then the hashing needs to be greater to ensure that they are secure and that will bring up the price. I don\'t see it happening that quickly, but I might be very wrong. A huge surge of newcomers coming in could increase the demand so much higher than the supply, that the price will have no choice but to go up. Mining hardware would be out of stock if that happened since it would technically be cheaper to mine it than to buy it. It will be an interesting ride watching all the variables interacting with each other.','What a bitcoin Can Be Priced At?','','publish','open','open','','what-can-bitcoins-be-valued-at','','','2015-01-26 01:53:48','2015-01-26 01:53:48','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9',0,'post','',0),(10,1,'2015-01-19 18:12:57','2015-01-19 18:12:57','The value of bitcoins could fall to a low level if there are not a lot of people that used it and they only used it for small transactions.

It provides very valuable services. Bitcoin is not being sold either. The term \"bitcoins\" is a store of value on the Bitcoin network. This store of value can be sent or received by anybody else with a wallet on the Bitcoin network. This transfer of value is the same service that the major credit card companies provide. Yet, Bitcoin provides the service for nearly free or potentially free. Credit card companies charge huge fees to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Take a look at how much Western Union charges to transfer money from person A in one country  to person B from another country.\r\n\r\nThis would be like calling the internet a Ponzi scheme or calling email a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is a protocol. That means it is just a set of standard rules that a network must follow. The rest of the network can verify if any single node is not following the rules and not accept the work that they performed. Data center provide their processing power for a fee to businesses that need a website. E-mail is free for the end user because the companies that are paying for the hosting is also placing ads and making revenues from the users that way. Since Bitcoin is such a useful financial instrument, it can not be a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can’t be selling a useful product. Some people are calling Bitcoin one of the greatest inventions of all time comparing it to the likes of the telephone. To call it a Ponzi scheme is completely inaccurate since it provides so much for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy bitcoins, you are buying a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. The USD is a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. Gold used to be a good store of wealth and excellent to trade for goods and services. However, it is very inefficient to send gold back and forth between people. The US Dollar was a receipt of gold before they detached its value from gold. It was then set by how much money they print and what people can get with the money that they have. Some financial institutions provide services like Bitcoin does, but they charge a large amount of fees to use it. Even if Bitcoin is not successful, it will be a competitor to the current financial markets and force them to lower the prices or risk losing customers. \r\n\r\nThe current institutions might try to make up for their losses by increasing their prices even more. This would, in turn, make more people try to find alternative sources. In the end, I think Bitcoin will be used around the globe and it will force the large financial institutions to lower their prices for their services.

It provides very valuable services. Bitcoin is not being sold either. The term \"bitcoins\" is a store of value on the Bitcoin network. This store of value can be sent or received by anybody else with a wallet on the Bitcoin network. This transfer of value is the same service that the major credit card companies provide. Yet, Bitcoin provides the service for nearly free or potentially free. Credit card companies charge huge fees to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Take a look at how much Western Union charges to transfer money from person A in one country  to person B from another country.\r\n\r\nThis would be like calling the internet a Ponzi scheme or calling email a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is a protocol. That means it is just a set of standard rules that a network must follow. The rest of the network can verify if any single node is not following the rules and not accept the work that they performed. Data center provide their processing power for a fee to businesses that need a website. E-mail is free for the end user because the companies that are paying for the hosting is also placing ads and making revenues from the users that way. Since Bitcoin is such a useful financial instrument, it can not be a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can’t be selling a useful product. Some people are calling Bitcoin one of the greatest inventions of all time comparing it to the likes of the telephone. To call it a Ponzi scheme is completely inaccurate since it provides so much for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy bitcoins, you are buying a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. The USD is a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. Gold used to be a good store of wealth and excellent to trade for goods and services. However, it is very inefficient to send gold back and forth between people. The US Dollar was a receipt of gold before they detached its value from gold. It was then set by how much money they print and what people can get with the money that they have. Some financial institutions provide services like Bitcoin does, but they charge a large amount of fees to use it. Even if Bitcoin is not successful, it will be a competitor to the current financial markets and force them to lower the prices or risk losing customers. The current institutions might try to make up for their losses by increasing their prices even more. This would, in turn, make more people try to find alternative sources. In the end, I think Bitcoin will be used around the globe and it will force the large financial institutions to lower their prices for their services. The financial institutions must adapt to meet the advancing technology that the human race is discovering. We are currently locked in an old system that a few wealthy individuals control.

This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary.

There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it constantly growing over time so every week it reaches another all time high.

That might be partly a reason for the declines in 2014. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. Currently, you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go about 25% down from the going rate. There are fewer sell orders until about 50% above going rate. So, more people are ready to buy then there are to sell as of the writing of this article. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate. This computing power will be directly proportional to the going rate. Over the long run, you can see that both the computer power and price have steadily grown since 2009.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. \r\n\r\nCurrently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market.

It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. \r\n\r\nBitcoin can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s).

It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy everyday to sustain the market. This is inflation. This is exactly what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half.The number of miners is growing. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it is growing. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. Also, the value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. There are fewer people that are willing to sell the bitcoin for prices any lower. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is huge.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. Once more people see that, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be a lot more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Currently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks, they don\'t want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed.

The way that it is done is that a hash of a document gets stored at an address on the Block Chain. The hash and date is now stored on the Block Chain for all of eternity.

It could then be sent over the internet without creating a printed out copy. That would be excellent for the environment since using electricity and computers is more efficient than paper. Think about how much effort is done to bring paper documents across the country. You could argue that an e-mail is also proof of existence. However, an e-mail is harder to verify and make publicly available. It is certainly not as secure of a method as using the Block Chain. E-mails can be erased from existence fairly easily. A transaction on the Block Chain will never be erased.\r\n\r\nHow would using the Block Chain for this affect the price of a bitcoin? I would argue that the more valuable the Block Chain is, the more secure it would become. And, the more secure that it would become, then everything that the Block Chain is used for that is useful would become more valuable. Miners secure the network and receive bitcoin as a reward. If bitcoins are not valuable, miners will not secure the network. The more valuable bitcoins and the Bitcoin network is, then the higher the price of a bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAny parties that have an interest in the Block Chain or bitcoins or any technology that utilizes Bitoin will have vested much and would support the system - they would not let it fail. If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will attempt to do that in order to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The Block Chain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for encrypted data to be sent over an un-encrypted network. \r\n\r\nBitcoin is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s. If someone can have an immutable proof of existence that the whole world can verify, that is huge! Using the Block Chain for this very task is extremely convenient!  I don\'t think Bitcoin or Block Chain will ever go away - it will exist as a historical artifact even after we stop using it. By the time it is obsolete, the human race will have at least inhabited several galaxies. Even then, it may still be useful. It may be one of the longest running and widely used currency, but we can\'t say for certainty just yet. We will have to wait and find out. I would recommend buying a few bitcoins just in case if Bitcoin and the Block Chain take off.','Proof of Existence','','publish','open','open','','proof-of-existence','','','2015-01-26 02:13:51','2015-01-26 02:13:51','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=21',0,'post','',0),(22,1,'2015-01-19 19:15:47','2015-01-19 19:15:47','The blockchain can be used to prove that a document existed at a certain date.

If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire value of bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction value with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were valued at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013. If Bitcoin could grab even 1% of the market, then the price will should go up much higher than it is.\r\n\r\nFor large organizations or individuals that want to trade a billion or more dollars worth of bitcoins, then they would either have to buy about a quarter of all bitcoins in circulation at the current rate. If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.','What Can Bitcoins Be Valued At','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2015-01-19 19:20:52','2015-01-19 19:20:52','',9,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=23',0,'revision','',0),(24,1,'2015-01-19 19:29:40','2015-01-19 19:29:40','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics1.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 30px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics1.gif\" alt=\"bitcoindynamics\" width=\"192\" height=\"380\" /></a>\r\nAmplification</b>\r\n\r\nA group of coordinated wealthy individuals or businesses could have a large impact on the market. The way the buys and sells are setup is that people make a bid to buy or sell a certain number of bitcoin at a certain price. There are only so many bitcoins listed on the market. If someone wanted to buy 10,000 bitcoins, then they would not be able to buy that many at the current market rates. There might only be 100 listed within +1% of current price, 1000 withing +5% of current price and 10,000 within +20% of current price. \r\n\r\nIf they wanted 10,000 bitcoins, then they would have to buy some of those bitcoin from sellers that list their price at higher than the current market rate. This would in turn bring the rate up. A single exchange might not be able to handle that many bitcoins without the price skyrocketing to +100% of current market rate. The wealthy individual would be better off buying 1,000 bitcoins from each of the major exchanges. They would need to buy a percentage of these bitcoins each day over a longer period of time in order to not cause a spike in the price. However, they would risk that the price goes into a temporary bubble or a longer term increase in price and they would end up paying more for the bitcoins then they would have if they just bought 10,000 outright. The market is extremely volatile! There would need to be a carefully planned entry into the market for these individuals to get a maximum amount of bitcoin for the most minimal price possible. There would be no perfect solution for this. It is a gamble on the unknown of the market.\r\n\r\n<b>High Prices</b>\r\n\r\nThe high price of bitcoins are making it so average people will not buy or use Bitcoin. The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. The actual price is irrelevant to their use since it is interchangeable with the USD. There are currently only 13.8 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million. There are 8 digits on the left of the dot and 8 digits on the right: \"13,800,000.12345678\". There is plenty of divisibility here. The high prices have a psychological effect on people in both directions - some people like the fact that the price of a single bitcoin is higher rather than there being 13 trillion bitcoins and there only ever being 21 trillion bitcoin. If the dot was shifted to the left 6 places like this 13,800,000,000,000.12 then, it would be fundamentally the same. Some people would prefer this for purely psychological reason.\r\n\r\nOnce more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase. Once the value of the market increases, bitcoins will have a higher price tag. The price will find an equilibrium between this and an uncountable (maybe countable) number of other factors. The price to mine a bitcoin will be factored into the price. Why would someone pay $400 for a bitcoin when they can mine one for $300 or less? The price to mine a bitcoin has been decreasing. This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine. The halving of the block reward that is predicted for around 2016 will make for a price increase of a possible factor of 2. \r\n\r\nMoore’s law suggests that computing power on a processor doubles every two years. For the ASICs that mine bitcoin, they have doubled every 6 months. This has huge implications in of itself! This will make it cheaper and cheaper to mine bitcoin. However, if the demand for bitcoins increases to a number larger than what the miners are generating and selling, then current bitcoin holders will sell their holding or the price will rise significantly. Buyers will have to be willing to spend the higher amount of cash for a bitcoin or wait for someone to sell at a lower price. That might not ever happen. Some people depend on selling their bitcoins to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to sell - they are forced to sell at low prices. All of these factors will make for a natural & free market. There could be short-lived crashes and bubbles, but I think the price will stay at around the price of mining with the supply &amp; demand factored into some complex equation.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot Commodity</b>\r\n\r\nPeople will want to get into Bitcoin.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. This process of halving continues until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. However, there is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market. Learn more about the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">Costs of Bitcoin</a> paid through inflation and transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9\">price of a bitcoin</a>. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. This is about a half a watt of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially. I would not be surprised to see rates of 0.01 W/GH/s in a few years from now. Moore\'s law states that processing power doubles every 18 months - the processing power for ASIC miners for Bitcoin doubles every 6 months. This time for doubling is shrinking. We could see doubling of processing power every month at some point in the future. Most people predicted that Moore\'s law would slow down, but this might not be the case. However, there are some physical limitations in our universe that will prevent us from further increasing processing power. I would say the most extreme limitation is the speed of light.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? It does create the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing surrounding Bitcoin mining. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi-attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there during the winter months. I use it as my little hobby/work room and the miners now provide, basically, free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoins until they, hopefully, reach much higher prices. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. I did buy them with a credit card on a 0% APR promotion so I would not have been able to purchase the bitcoins directly with my credit card as I can with the mining hardware. I will also be able to, hopefully, sell the miners in May when the warm weather approaches. This makes mining profitable for my specific case. \r\n\r\nTypically, the only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining & Exchanges</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can potentially make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that Moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years.\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahash, exahash, zettahash or yottahash. Those are real words, too! petahash means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahash means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. \r\n\r\nThe mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. \r\n\r\nDuring price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 15,000 times higher than the world\'s 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn\'t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. \r\n\r\nHowever, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of nations to protect its\' citizens assets and interests. Citizens from many nations have vested interest in Bitcoin. An attack on the Bitcoin network by individuals will be regarded as an act of terrorism against all the countries who have citizens that are vested in Bitcoin. Nations would be obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. If a nation attacked the Bitcoin network, it will be viewed as an act of cyber-warfare against many nations at once. People argue that the Bitcoin can\'t be legitimate because there is no nation that backs it. However, there are many nations that back it. It already has more backing by more nations than any other currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 15,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. I know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 10 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-19 19:42:01','2015-01-19 19:42:01','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=28',0,'revision','',0),(29,1,'2015-01-19 19:46:54','2015-01-19 19:46:54','<b>Mining Rewards</b>\r\n\r\nCurrently, miners are getting a reward for mining. This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime in 2017. This keeps getting cut in half every four years until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. There is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out how much a bitcoin is worth. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahertz in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. Who could have imagined something like this even 20 years ago? I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there. I use it as my little hobby/work room and it is free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore because of the costs. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoin until they, hopefully, reach higher levels. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. The only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? But, it creates the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Miners Selling Cloud Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years. Since the ASICs for bitcoin mining came into existence over the past couple of years, the computational power for the bitcoin mining computers has doubled every 6 months and it appears as though this doubling every 6 months will continue here on forward.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining Exchange</b>\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin.

The mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price.

Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use it to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain backwards and forward. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. They could track down a network of criminals &amp; terrorists.\r\n\r\nI’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this as an excuse to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have to compete besides lowering their rates for their services. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams - very large salaries &amp; bonuses depend on it! If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well ban airplanes since terrorists use them to crash into buildings. If a government bans Bitcoin with that logic, then they ought to start making it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to commit terrorism. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. These related arguments against Bitcoin does not hold up if using reasonable logic.\r\n\r\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\r\n\r\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins were created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. The anonymity is that the addresses are not associated to anybody. Once the addresses are associated to individuals, then their is no anonymity. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nOnce a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person could possibly be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. It is possible that the bitcoins were legally obtained. It would be wise to keep detailed documentation if you are planning on doing a lot of business with bitcoins.

If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government.\r\n\r\n<strong>Court Orders</strong>\r\n\r\nA court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\r\n\r\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities.

If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities. I’m not sure how far down a chain the US government could seize dollars that originated from an illegal activity, but similar laws might be applied to bitcoin in the future.','Unethical Bitcoin Uses','','inherit','open','open','','31-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 00:56:50','2015-01-20 00:56:50','',31,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=32',0,'revision','',0),(33,1,'2015-01-20 02:17:16','2015-01-20 02:17:16','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\" alt=\"bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\r\n\r\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks.

The nodes that manage the network would be rewarded with commissions if they behave well. If they try to mess up the results, the rest of the network would find out and cut them out for new traffic immediately. This would be a decentralization of the network.

There is no need for corporations to have a monopoly on the system and take huge cuts. Some of the cuts that they take go to pay the banks the fees for their transactions.

I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than the current services if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\r\n\r\n<b>Alt-coins</b>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it. Bitcoin is already \"the\" digital currency and it would be difficult for an alternative to surpass it.\r\n\r\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\r\n\r\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be possible. However, the heat giving off from mining could be a valuable resource. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\r\n\r\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\r\n\r\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place.

A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to upvote it and downvote it. The more upvotes, the more bitcoin the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoin back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population. If it gets all downvotes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam. I think those articles could be spotted by requiring at least a few people see it and they could have a power attribute to the votes. Maybe they could upvote by +1, +2 and +3 and downvote -1, -2, -3. Voters could be shown some guidelines to not downvote a controversial issue. Sometimes a large percentage of the population has bad feelings towards some issues that were illegal or immoral that might now be regarded as legal and moral. Some of the bitcoin generated from the bad content could also be given to the customers that view the content. This could be done with money but the fees might be too high for content creators to put up a deposit. A content creator might only want to <i>and need to</i> put up $0.25 for their content. That would be impossible to do with a credit card. Amateurs might spend years attempting to create good content and want to try to publish it, but they don’t have money to pay for advertising. Google is good for organizing content so that people can find it, but they typically favor the same large media outlets. They also place a lot of advertisements that would avert users away from finding their content. This would also entice advertisers to produce better content and pay the users for finding it. That money currently goes to Google and there is a ton of it going there. That money could stay between the merchants and the customers. All of the money that gets paid to Google would remain in the pockets of the merchants and the customers. This system would also hurt entities that attempted to make bad content because they would have to fork over all their bitcoin to the customers and merchants. Add that to all the money that the merchants and customers save from having to “pay” for advertisements. Both the merchants and the customers pay for those advertisements because the merchant relies on the advertisement to reach the customer. The merchant then has to raise the price of the product to make a profit. The customer pays the increased fee. When you shop at shopping sites, the shopping site takes in a large amount of profits from their merchants and customers. A new system could be created that cut them out and give those profits directly to the merchants and customers. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks. There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the most efficient 3rd parties.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nA third-party could use Bitcoin to create digital wallets. One user could create and store the first half of the password and the other user could create and store the second half of the password. This could help parties come into an agreement without as much risk. If one party does not honor their commitments, then the funds are stuck in the wallet forever. This could entice both sides of the parties to honor their agreements.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that.

The big miners would own a lot of the new coins and people with money could buy them. There would be no little guys. I don\'t think any of the alt-coins out right now are going to surpass Bitcoin. There are some interesting alt-coins where the processing is used to solve useful mathematical equations. A currency like Primecoin might get larger since the hashing algorithm also looks for prime numbers and those prime numbers are useful for scientist and engineers.\r\n\r\nA new system could not be based on pure randomness for each wallet because whoever has the most wallets would get the most coins. It will end up being a race for whoever has the most computing power because the person with the most computing power could create the most wallets. Bitcoin has a good lead on any new crypto-currency since it has had so much time to mature. Currently, the newcomers with the most hashing power will earn the biggest rewards. If a similar system came out now, then the few major miners would take a majority of the mining reward. It would be a monopoly on the system. It is good that there were some little guys that got in at the beginning of Bitcoin. It is still the beginning of Bitcoin, so there is plenty of room for late stage newcomers.\r\n\r\n<b>Proof of Work</b>\r\n\r\nProof of Work is the hashing that a miner does to show that a large investment was made to verify the transactions. It is a difficult math problem that needs to be solved by an ASIC. The rest of the nodes then validate the miners work. This is necessary because if there was no proof of work, then there would be bad nodes that would try to manipulate the system. This ensures that there will be no bad actors because it would be expensive to attempt and difficult to achieve. It is easy to verify that a miner did the correct work.\r\n\r\nHere is an alternative proof of work that might be effective: a node gains power through validating &amp; processing transactions. The more correct transactions that the node has  verified, the more power it has on the network. As soon as a powerful node is caught making an incorrect transaction, then they would lose power. The network would also correct the inaccurate transaction that the bad node might have attempted to change. The transactions would have to have a maximum of a single unit. This system is feasible and it is not so expensive to operate. If a system like this could verify transactions as Bitcoin does, then Bitcoin could be in trouble since it will take far less computing power. As there are more transactions on Bitcoin, an adaption to the protocol could be made to allow for miners to spend more computing power on validating and processing transactions instead of just hashing to prove they are doing work.\r\n\r\nBitcoin would be an ancestor system to any new ones. I think it will always be around. If a new methodology arises then Bitcoin could be adapted to follow it.\r\n\r\n<b>Unfair</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of people argue that it is unfair that the ownership of all the bitcoins is skewed towards such a small number of people. The miners that provided just a small amount of computing power at the beginning and held onto their bitcoins will have made an extremely large amount of money from a network that other miners are supporting. With the growing computing power that is needed, a newcomer has to provide thousands and thousands of times more hashing than the very first miners back in 2009-2012. With the maturity of bitcoin compared to any other crypto-currency, it would be hard to make another more fair currency. Whoever gets in on the next currency first will have more coins. If the algorithm was designed to not reward so many coins at the beginning, then that would make it more fair for people that come in later. With the price lowering as of early 2015, this should force some of the early adopters to sell some of their bitcoins to others that are interested in joining the market. However, the earliest adopters built the system. It wouldn\'t be here if it wasn\'t for them. Maybe they deserve the rewards.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, there will be some early adopters that might join the status of billionaire (USD). Currently, there are 1,645 billionaires in the world. There were 268 newcomers in 2014. There is plenty of room for a few more of them. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has over 1 million bitcoins. When the price of bitcoin surged to over $1,100, Satoshi’s worth was valued over $1 Billion. However, if he tried to sell them all for $1,1000 each or any price, the demand would fall and the price of the bitcoin would fall with it probably right down to $20. I don’t think bitcoin is going to shift the wealth of the world very much. Those early adopters would be better off slowly selling bitcoins over the years. If they sell too many, the price will plummet. If they hold onto them, the price should rise, but it will be lowered once they start to sell them. They will need to sell some of them to live a billionaire lifestyle. - not everybody accepts bitcoin as a payment. Even if they do accept bitcoin as a payment, then the bitcoin will be distributed more. Wealthy people will get their hands on their share of the bitcoin. They have the power to manipulate the bitcoin markets and get it from the early adopters for cheaper than what it will be worth in the future. In the long run, I think the bitcoin will end up mostly in the pockets of the existing rich people. And, it will create a lot of new wealthy people.\r\n\r\n<b>Advancement of Processing</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is speeding up the rate at which computation advances.

The credit card company then authorizes the transaction resulting in the <i>pull transaction</i>.

With credit cards and ACH, there is a wait period before the money is sent. Also, the money can only sent to merchants that have shared all of their information with the bank or credit card company. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, then the merchant will not receive the funds from the credit card company. The merchant, in turn, makes up for these losses by raising there prices. The consumer ends up paying for this. The credit card companies also advertise that they offer fraud protection, but it is really the merchant that is being forced to offer the fraud protection.\r\n\r\n<b>Centralization vs Decentralization</b>\r\n\r\nThere will have to be a balance between centralization and decentralization. Pure centralization would mean there is one large organization that controls everything. Pure decentralization would mean that each person contributes nearly an equal amount of effort to the system. There must be a balance between these two. We can’t go too far in  either direction or we won’t progress with technology. If we start heading in one direction, a revolutionary product will come out that will bring it back in the other direction. Look back at the mainframes - they were a centralized computer system where dumb terminals would connect to them. Then, we switched towards decentralization by having all the processing power in each individual device. More recently, we have gone back in the direction of centralization with cloud services. Bitcoin is a revolutionary service that is leaning towards decentralization - anybody can have a bank on their own computer. In the end, there will be computation going on everywhere - centralized and decentralized.\r\n\r\n<b>Risky Owning Lots of Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep hard copies of large quantities of bitcoins in fire proof safes or in an insured account - otherwise it is a risk and precautions need to be taken. Businesses surrounding safe bitcoin storage are arising. If bitcoins are not stored very carefully, they could be corrupted, lost or stolen. There have been countless tales of people losing bitcoins by computer crashes or having them stolen by hackers. $500,000,000.00, at the time of the theft, were stolen from customers on Mt. Gox.\r\n\r\nThe problem of safely storing large amounts of bitcoin will stop some investors from jumping on board right away. They will wait for an easy to understand and secure solution. They want their accounts to be insured by the FDIC. These services are being launched in Q1 2015. There is a market for professionals to advise wealthy individuals in purchasing bitcoin for their investment portfolio and this market will grow exponentially.\r\n\r\nIt is very dangerous to hold a large amount of cash since it can be lost or stolen. For Credit Cards, they pass the fraud expenses onto the businesses and customers. The loss is distributed more in CC - with bitcoin, it is more easy for an individual to get targeted and lose a lot. It would be a good general rule that if you have a large sum of bitcoins, then you better know exactly what you are doing or hire someone that knows what they are doing. And, make sure you trust the person that you hire - it would be easy for them to steal your bitcoins. Those bitcoins are almost certainly gone forever.\r\n\r\n<b>Banking for All</b>\r\n\r\nA high school student will have the power to run his or her own bank. A high school student from a 3rd world country will have the ability to run his or her own bank. 2/3’s of the worlds population does not have access to banking right now. Most of them have or will have mobile phones with internet access. They will be able to use Bitcoin and get access to the same banking systems that the rest of the world. They will be able to make orders for deliveries of items which otherwise might be more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the not too future, drones will be able to deliver items to places around the world. This is not going to happen for many years, but large companies are currently working on drones that deliver items to people’s doorsteps. If this method of delivering goods proves successful, which it will, then drone development will grow exponentially and we will have drones that can deliver anything, anywhere at anytime. Since Bitcoin can be easily used by anyone, anywhere, at any time and for any amount of money, it will align well with an international drone delivery system.\r\n\r\nSpaceX and Facebook have been looking to create satellites that will allow everybody on the planet to get on the internet. They will be providing cheap mobile phones for little to no costs. Facebook will be able to monetize the traffic from all the new users, so they have an incentive to move fast on this venture. These new people on the web will probably all be using Bitcoin for their financial needs - it is an international digital currency that allows any two parties anywhere on the planet to immediately exchange wealth for nearly free. I should say free since the costs will be absorbed by 3rd party apps that will monetize the traffic with advertisements.\r\n\r\nHistory has never allowed for such a huge leap in financial internationalization before. Gold and the USD came the closest to allowing this so far; Bitcoin is the next chapter in this process. There has already been a confirmed transaction from somebody from North Korea. It is rare and highly illegal for residents of North Korea to make financial contact with anyone outside the country.\r\n\r\n<b>Getting People on Board</b>\r\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle right now is getting people on board. Bitcoin has a bad name and it sounds like it is from a cartoon. People that never heard about Bitcoin before usually laugh when I try to explain it to them. One way to get people on board is by giving free and/or cheap bitcoins in order to get people to become familiar with the name Bitcoin and build trust in the Bitcoin system. For the average person, a very small amount, maybe $1, should be seeded to individuals that otherwise would not get into Bitcoin. For the wealthy people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. The bitcoins need to be re-distributed from the early adopters to a larger population in order to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream. The early adopters will still benefit because the value of the entire Bitcoin network goes up for each new person that starts using Bitcoin.

This would be bad for the early adopters but good to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream.\r\n\r\n<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. A system called Ripple might be able to accomplish this.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted lie TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin is Financial Tools','','inherit','open','open','','37-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 03:21:44','2015-01-20 03:21:44','',37,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=38',0,'revision','',0),(39,1,'2015-01-20 03:21:54','2015-01-20 03:21:54','<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\r\n\r\nCredit cards are a pull technology.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoins, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some at fair market rate. The price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. The price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoins - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoins ever and there is currently about 14,000,000 as of early 2015. Most bitcoins have already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoins per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoins per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoins - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with Bitcoin since bitcoins are fluid. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even in virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency that can be used for real tangible products. A two-way virtual currency is one that can be converted from USD and back. Most virtual currencies are one way - you can trade USD for the virtual currency but you can\'t trade the virtual currency for USD. Bitcoin is different since it has so many uses.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have not yet been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be innovative products that will allow Bitcoin to be used more conveniently than the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount of wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers” or just lucky. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering. Some individuals that have large amounts of bitcoins could become billionaires if Bitcoin goes main stream. You can view the <a href=\"http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100\">BitcoinRichList</a>. The numbers are actually worse than what is displayed at that website. Most large holders of bitcoins have their bitcoins spread out among many different addresses. There are a small number of people that own a large percentage of the bitcoins. This is also true for most currencies and stocks.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nPeople have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current payment methods illegal? They could try to ban Bitcoin stating \"<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\">Terrorists Use Bitcoin</a>\". The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. Some nations are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country\">banning Bitcoin</a>. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is nearly doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue or accelerate.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin will continue to maintain its\' price over the long run. It is unique and valuable. It can\'t die because the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35\">Bitcoin network</a> is too powerful. I don\'t see that Bitcoin will be replaced since it is a protocol that can be updated upon agreement of the community. If some feature is desired and the community agrees that it is good, then it should be incorporated into the protocol. This is similar to the HTTP and WWW protocol. The network won\'t be replaced by a superior technology since it can be updated. For the short term, Bitcoin will be volatile - that is, the price will fluctuate up and down. You may purchase bitcoins and find out that it lost 30% of its price in a week. However, the average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since it was first launched in 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting to buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time they will buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market. However, this volatility should go away as more people are in the market. More people will buy bitcoins when the price goes down and sell bitcoins when the price goes up. This will stop spikes and crashes. The more people that are in Bitcoin, the more pressure there will be on the price. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is low and buy thus bringing the price up. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is high and sell thus bring the price down. Over time, the price will continue to increase just as it has been doing since 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Price</b>\r\n\r\nThe price of a single bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. These trades will set the current price. The latest trade price will be the advertised current price of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand.\r\n\r\nSome people think that a single bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the price will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are currently hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s and growing every month. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of a bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $200 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$400. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin and it won\'t stay above what it costs to mine for any significant period of time.\r\n\r\nI would approximate that it costs about $150 to mine a bitcoin in an industrial setting. It costs $200+ to mine one from home. Whatever the price to mine a bitcoin, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. Overtime, the rewards to mine get cut in half, so it becomes more expensive to mine. Once that happens, the price should rise. Also, if demand is greater than the number of bitcoins mined, then the price will rise. If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\r\n\r\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoins will be redirected to purchasing bitcoins directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that the price of a bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into Bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoins immediately after receiving them - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how Bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the price of a bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoins for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoins and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoins and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-investments','','http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35','2015-01-31 05:42:05','2015-01-31 05:42:05','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=40',0,'post','',0),(41,1,'2015-01-20 03:40:14','2015-01-20 03:40:14','<b>Bitcoin Hoarders</b>\r\n\r\nHoarding will have to be balanced. If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some a fair market rate. They price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. Again, the price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoin - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoin ever and there is currently about 14,000,000. Most bitcoin has already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoin per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoin per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoin - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with bitcoin. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Printing Hard Copy of Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be possible to have a wallet containing bitcoin converted to paper. Further, someone could verify that the paper wallet still contains the bitcoin. This would be done with a barcode. The password could be built into the barcode, so that it could be redeemed by whoever possesses it. A potential security problem for this would be that someone could steal it by taking a picture of it. A scratch off surface such as on lottery tickets could be utilized. A trusted corporation could manufacture a large number of these scratch cards and sell them at a small mark-up. It would be a huge business. The government is not as efficient as the free market! There have already been offline hard versions of bitcoin created <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins\">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins</a> Casascius. These physical coins can hold value of 1, 10, 100 or 1000 bitcoins. I have a feeling there will be a version two of these items in smaller decrements and cheaper mediums like scratch off tickets.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be ingenious inventions that will allow Bitcoin or some similar currency be used just as the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin is the Next...</b>\r\n\r\nBitcon is not the next Facebook, Apple, Google or Bank of America. It should be looked at more like the next telephone, internet or e-mail. It is the next step in the evolution of technology on our planet. I wouldn\'t be surprised if there are other intelligent life forms in our universe that use, have used, or will use some form of crypto-currency during their evolution.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers”. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nIt is currently a monopoly. People have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current VISA/MasterCard/American Express/Discover/Western Union illegal? The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is near doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue.\r\n\r\n<b>“The” Money of the Future</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin will not be “the” money of the future. It will be “a” money of the future. It will have applicability in the international free market. The free markets in the world have always won and caused for greater innovation. Markets that are not free will fall behind the free markets since a free market sparks the greatest innovation. People can competitively attempt to solve problems.  Humans are naturally a competitive species. It is the only way we can prosper.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Credit &amp; Financing</b>\r\n\r\nPeople want credit. There is currently no credit with Bitcoin. You will not, yet, get the same 0% APR for 18 months with a $10,000 limit as easily as you could with VISA/MasterCard/American Express/Discover. People would rather spend money that they don’t have to pay immediately. Most people have debt that they would rather put that money towards so they don’t have to pay interest on it. That entire concept is another story. Hopefully, there will be Bitcoin credit cards where people with excellent credit can get a 10 bitcoin credit where they must pay back just like they do with current credit cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nEven if Bitcoin is replaced with a superior digital currency, it will continue to maintain some value. Whether it will be a collector’s item in the future or adopted as the mainstream digital currency is a thought to ponder. I’m certain that a competitor to the current financial system will come into existence.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market.\r\n\r\n<b>Value</b>\r\n\r\nThe value of the bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges.

This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $250 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$600. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin. I would approximate it that it costs at least $200 a bitcoin to mine. That might not be accurate, but whatever the price is, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. If the price does fall below, the money used to mine bitcoin will be redirected to purchasing bitcoin directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin.

People are psychological creatures and 1 bitcoin will be a milestone for someone to own. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket. There does not yet exist 14 million bitcoin and it will not happen for at least a few months into 2015. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. 90% of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and people that got into bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoin immediately after receiving it. If this is how bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and other reasons. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this as an important factor.\r\n\r\n<b>Balancing Account</b>\r\n\r\nSome variation of a spending &amp; saving account could conceptually be created. They would contain an equal amount of bitcoin and dollar when adding funds to it could be used to maximize saving and spending. If the price of bitcoin has fallen since making a deposit, then spend cash on the current purchase. If the price of bitcoin has risen since making a deposit, then spend bitcoin on the current purchase.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital Funds In General</b><strong><strong>\r\n</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nPeople are going to want an international digital currency. People want access to their funds in any currency that they would want online. This needs to be done without the user having to do any manual actions.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Arbitrage</b>\r\n\r\nArbitrage is when investors buy a bitcoin from one exchange at a lower price and sell it at another price for a higher price. This balances the price between the exchanges. It can be profitable for the investors engaged in this activity. It is a risk, though. If the price is crashing before they make the buy and sell.\r\n\r\n<b>Outsourcing Financing to Machines</b><strong><strong>\r\n</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nBitcoin can manage financing for cheaper than the current banks. The overhead to support all of the millionaires and billionaires in our current financial markets is overwhelming. The rich are feeding off of the economy one transaction at a time.\r\n\r\n<b>Trading Stocks</b>\r\n\r\nThe value of a stock counts on the value of the service that the business provides. Bitcoin has a valuable service. The value of this service will be reflected in the value of a single bitcoin and in the value of the businesses surrounding bitcoin. As long as the 51% of the servers is not taken over by a malicious attacker, then bitcoin should retain some value. Even if the 51% attack was to happen, there would be a fork that the rest of the community would start moving forward with.\r\n\r\n<b>Infinitely Divisible</b>\r\n\r\nA bitcoin can be divided up to very small parts. My sample wallet address 1HdXXkqjmHcTdX5FyMMUkARP6i4rtr1C74 from Bitcoin Core currently states a balance of 0.00007303 BTC.\r\n\r\n<b>Volatility Insurance</b>\r\n\r\nCompanies are afraid to hold onto bitcoin that they receive because it could go down by 20% in the next few days. That would make them lose money on a sale. An insurance to cover volatility could be created. It could be commission based on the fluctuations. The insurance company would collect a percentage of the increase in value in an exchange to cover the dips in value. This would take the risk out of a crash for some companies that may hold bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin is a Trustless Currency</b>\r\n\r\nThe parties do not need to trust each other for an exchange to happen. For credit cards and ACH, a lot of trust is required. That is not so much for the credit card case, but it is not a good experience to have your credit card numbers stolen. Your credit card company is responsible to cover any unauthorized purchases on your account. With bitcoin, if you use it properly, somebody can’t steal any bitcoin from you if you don’t give them your password and/or private key.\r\n\r\n<b>Insured Bitcoin Accounts</b>\r\n\r\nThere are currently insured accounts available at some exchanges. I’m sure more will grow. They are responsible for any bitcoin that was lost or stolen because of them. This includes hackers attacking their systems. It does not include someone getting ahold of your username and password. Also, they usually have 2 factor authentication so they would need your password and either your email or cellphone authentication. Authentication would be done by sending an e-mail with a confirmation link or sending a text message with a confirmation code that needs to be entered into the site before a transaction can take place. Fund that are stolen from a traditional debit card are usually not insured. However, funds stolen off of a credit card are usually covered by the credit card company. Those funds come from the consumers through fees and high interest rates. The problem with insurance is relatively easy to address for Bitcoin. Corporations will provide this service. They will need to make a profit for that service, so bitcoin holders that choose these services will probably pay for them. Some companies make their profits through other ways that will offload the costs to the customer.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 03:40:14','2015-01-20 03:40:14','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=41',0,'revision','',0),(42,1,'2015-01-20 03:44:31','2015-01-20 03:44:31','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-151\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\" alt=\"nuclear bomb explosion\" width=\"447\" height=\"447\" /></a></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\n\r\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two nations won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have the potential to destroy the other. Like a nuclear war between superpowers, there can be no winners. The Bitcoin network lives on the same principle. Too many people have investments in Bitcoin to allow it to fail. Nobody would benefit from somebody breaking the integrity of Bitcoin. If someone pulls a 51% attack, then people would lose the trust in the system and bitcoin would lose all of its value. The perpetrators would make now gains because the system would be destroyed. Any parties that are interested in Bitcoin will attempt to prevent such an attack. The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin network and their supporters will back the integrity of the system.\r\n\r\nGovernments will back the integrity of the system because they are obligated to protect their citizens\' interests. However, there will be controversy when governments attempt to freeze wallet addresses on the blockchain that contain illegally obtained bitcoin. The protocol does not currently support these freezes, but could governments force such a change? Scroll down to read about the proposed Hot List.\r\n\r\n<b>Network of Trust</b>\r\n\r\nIf all the parties can come to a fair agreement of how much hashing power is needed, then there wouldn\'t need to be a race to the bottom by wasting efforts on mining. It is naturally competitive as to reward the parties with the most hashing power. This agreement will not come as a verbal agreement between the parties but it will be agreed upon naturally through the price of a bitcoin.\r\n\r\nLike in real life, no one party will want to take over more than 51% of the network because the value of the system would dwindle and their profits would dwindle. There will always be several large competitors that will prevent any one entity from controlling 51% of the network.\r\n\r\nSomeone that has control of 51% of the network will want to keep the integrity of the transactions - they would not benefit from altering any information in the network. The system will maintain a natural balance between people around the world - they will want to be friendly with each other. A majority of people are good and the network is an image of the miners and users of Bitcoin. It is a natural trust based system with laws to hold integrity.\r\n\r\nThe price of a bitcoin will be worth what people will make it worth. People will naturally make the Bitcoin network worth the services that it provides. If it does provide all the services of banking and credit cards and a whole lot more, then it will be extremely valuable. All parties that are involved with Bitcoin will want it to continue to succeed. An attack from outside the bitcoin network would be the most likely since Bitcoin competitors would benefit from the system failing. However, it would be cheaper for an outside party to buy into the network and try to control it from within. Terrorists will not ever acquire enough power to take down 51% of the network. Governments may have the power to do this. But, the governments that have that much power would be able to acquire control of much of bitcoin through mining and purchasing bitcoin. Also, governments are obligated to protect their citizens\' assets.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin vs Manual Audits</b>\r\n\r\nA transaction and store of value system like the current financial institutions use manual audits to ensure the integrity of their network. Any business can be audited to make sure all transactions are accurate and complete. If they are not, they will suffer legal consequences. Is the current setup of audits more efficient than Bitcoin mining? I would say no since the credit card and bank fees are so high. A competitor, like Bitcoin, will ensure that the financial institutions are working as efficiently as possible because if they don\'t, then their customers may leave. The financial institutions will have to be able to compete with the services that Bitcoin is offering and they have to do it with either more quality, better security, or for cheaper. Options are always a good thing for consumers. It will force the financial sector to compete for customers. They may use many methods to compete.\r\n\r\n<b>Attention in Media</b>\r\n\r\nIt can be profitable for news agencies to report on the fallacies of Bitcoin. These reports, in turn, make Bitcoin less valuable. It is a downward spiral. However, people communicate with each other. There are lots of more people using Bitcoin and their are <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">statistics</a> to prove it. They will teach their friends of its’ advantages. Their friends will teach their friends and that cycle will continue until the general public is educated about the facts of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Community Agrees To Update</b>\r\n\r\nIf a general consensus among the Bitcoin miners agree to change the protocol, then this could have significant implications for the digital currency. This happens a lot for minor updates and is discussed in the Bitcoin community for major changes. A hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin miners might want to change the having of Bitcoin rewards to every 8 years instead of every 4 years is possible, but it is unlikely that a majority of people would agree to that. It would be profitable for the miners to do such a thing. But, this would cause belief in the system to dwindle and hurt them more than reward them.\r\n\r\nPeople value bitcoin as a store of wealth and unethical changes to the protocol would cause the price to plummet. Many miners are deeply vested into Bitcoin and they do not want this to happen because it would not be beneficial to them. If something like this did happen, there would probably be a fork and the existing version would run in parallel to the new version. That would be terrible for the system for everyone involved. People would have to decide which fork to choose between. Current holders would want the old version and people that want to get on board might want the new version. I think that the community would see all the struggles that taking such an action would cause and they would not want to damage the market that they exist in. These scenarios are hypothetical and not practical.\r\n\r\n<b>Fork</b>\r\n\r\nA fork in Bitcoin is when there are two separate versions that have been worked on and they share a previous point where they were the same - they share a common ancestor. For example, github hosts software projects for developers and when someone has a public project up there, someone else could fork a copy of the current version and start working on it in parallel. The original developer would also be working on the original version. They could both save their copies and they would be different and not share the changes that were made by both of the parties. Some people suggest that a fork in the bitcoin could be used. It would take a majority of the miners to approve a different version that will be accepted by the community. In practice, there would be an overwhelming majority that agrees to any updates because it would not be beneficial to anyone otherwise. It would be a guaranteed loss for everyone!\r\n\r\nIn the event that a successful 51% attack on the system happens, there would be a fork with the 49% that maintains the integrity. Users would have to ensure they are using the \"good\" fork. This attack is theoretically possible but in practice, it is impossible.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot List</b>\r\n\r\nHypothetically, there could be a hot list added to Bitcoin. If enough miners agreed to update the core code, then a hot list of addresses holding stolen bitcoins could be frozen. They would then be able to use them for legitimate uses. This would render those bitcoins nearly useless and it would make it not so profitable for bad people to steal bitcoins from people. This would be hard to maintain and it should be hard for a person to place addresses in a hot list but it would be beneficial for the entire system and help it be accepted in the mainstream. The original holder of the bitcoins would have to prove that the bitcoins do indeed belong to them. Once it is on the host list, it would be worth little to nothing. This might even influence some hackers to give the bitcoin back for an agreed small percentage of legal bitcoin. This hot list would probably only be feasible for large thefts.\r\n\r\n<b>Charitable Donations</b>\r\n\r\nWhen you donate money to a 3rd world country, not all of that money reaches there. If you wanted to donate $1, probably about $0.10 will reach the hungry child that you wanted to feed and the other $0.90 ends up going to the 3rd parties in between. With Bitcoin, it will be possible to donate $1 to starving children and $1 will reach its targeted donation. The implications of what Bitcoin could do for the world are huge. It is <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">arguably free</a> to use! There will be 3rd party applications that will absorb any costs to send money. The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\r\n\r\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes. This is currently the case, but it is easy to convert bitcoins to USD and possibly in the future, the IRS might reconsider. NYC is proposing allowing people to <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/31/new-york-parking-ticket-app/\">pay parking tickets with bitcoins</a>. This would save the people and the city a lot of money in financial fees with credit cards and the costs associated with mailing checks. Bitcoin would be useful for collecting tolls on highways for the same reasons. People could get a sticker on their car and have the payment automatically go through. This would save the highway management and people money by cutting out the banks from the middle of the transaction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin Theories & Concepts','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-theories-concepts','','\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97','2015-01-31 06:32:43','2015-01-31 06:32:43','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=42',0,'post','',0),(43,1,'2015-01-20 03:44:31','2015-01-20 03:44:31','<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\n\r\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two countries won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have to potential to destroy the other. Like a nuclear war between superpowers, there can be no winners. The Bitcoin network lives on the principle. Too many people have investments in Bitcoin to allow it to fail. Nobody would benefit from somebody breaking the integrity of Bitcoin. If someone pulls a 51% attack, then people would lose the trust in the system and bitcoin would lose all of its value. Any parties that are interested in Bitcoin will attempt to prevent such an attack. The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin network and their supporters would back the integrity of the system. Governments will back the integrity of the system. However, there will be controversy when governments start freezing wallet addresses on the blockchain that contain illegally obtained bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Network of Trust</b>\r\n\r\nIf all the parties can come to a fair agreement of how much hashing power, then there wouldn\'t need to be a race to the bottom by wasting efforts on mining. It is naturally competitive as to reward the parties with the most hashing power. Like in real life, no one party will want to take over more than 51% because the value of the system will dwindle. Someone that has control of 51% of the network will want to keep the integrity of the transactions - they would not benefit from altering any information in the network. It will maintain a natural balance between people around the world. People around the world will want to be friendly with each other. A majority of people are good and the network is an image of the miners and users of Bitcoin. It is a trust based system. The value of a bitcoin will be worth what people will make it worth. People will naturally make the Bitcoin network worth what it provides. If it does provide all the services of banking and credit cards and a whole lot more, then it will be extremely valuable. All parties that are involved with Bitcoin will want it to continue to succeed. An attack from outside the bitcoin network would be the most likely. However, it would be cheaper for an outside party to buy into the network and try to control it from within. Terrorists will not ever acquire enough power to take down 51% of the network. Governments may have the power to do this. But, the governments that have that much power would be able to acquire control of much of bitcoin through mining and purchasing bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin vs Checks and Balances</b>\r\n\r\nA transaction and store of value system like the current financial institutions use checks and balances to ensure the integrity of their network. Any business can be audited to make sure all transactions are accurate and complete. Is the current setup of checks and balances more efficient than Bitcoin mining? I can’t answer that for sure, but a competitor, like Bitcoin, will ensure that the financial institutions are working as efficiently as possible. They will have to be able to compete with the services that Bitcoin is offering and they have to do it with either more quality or for cheaper. Options are always a good thing for consumers. It will force the financial sector to compete for customers. They may use many methods to compete.\r\n\r\n<b>Attention in Media</b>\r\n\r\nIt can be profitable for news agencies to report on the fallacies of Bitcoin. These reports, in turn, make Bitcoin less valuable. It is a downward spiral. However, people communicate with each other. There are lots of people using Bitcoin. They will teach their friends of its’ advantages. Their friends will teach their friends and that cycle will continue until the general public is educated about the facts of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Weakness: Destroy bitcoins</b>\r\n\r\nIf wealthy and powerful people wanted to, they could slowly buy the bitcoin up and destroy them. This would take them out of the market. This would also drive up the price of bitcoin and have people not want to buy in. However, destroying bitcoins may drive up the value of the existing bitcoins in circulation. Limiting circulation of Bitcoin will certainly devalue it. It might be a weakness in Bitcoin that could be exploited by the Bitcoin opposition. This would induce people to sell their bitcoins when the price rises especially at what looks like the end of a bubble or beginning of a crash. The extremely wealthy has enough wealth to swing the bitcoin price and get a hold of a vast majority of bitcoins and then destroy them. The strategy could easily backfire and only make Bitcoin more popular. This is a purely speculative theory which is very unlikely, but it is not impossible.\r\n\r\n<b>Community Agrees To Update</b>\r\n\r\nIf a general consensus among the Bitcoin miners agree to change the protocol, then this could have significant implications for the digital currency. This happens a lot for minor updates and is discussed in the Bitcoin community for major changes. There are scenarios where Bitcoin miners might want to change the having of Bitcoin rewards to every 8 years instead of every 4 years. I doubt that there would be a 51% or more agreeing to that in the community. It would be profitable for the miners to do such a thing. But, this would cause belief in the system to dwindle. People value bitcoin as a store of value and the price would plummet. Many miners are deeply vested into Bitcoin and they do not want this to happen because it would not be beneficial to them in the long run. This goes against the fundamental principles of a majority of the mining community. I don’t think that would happen. If it did, there would probably be a fork and the existing version would run in parallel to the new version. Then people would have to decide which fork to choose between. Current holders would want the old version and people that want to get on board and the miners might want the new version. I think that the community would see all the struggles that taking such an action would cause and they would not want to damage the market that they exist in.\r\n\r\n<b>Fork</b>\r\n\r\nA fork is in Bitcoin is when there are two separate version that have been worked on and they share a previous point where they were the same. For example, github hosts software projects for developers. If someone has a public project up there, I could fork a copy of the current version and start working on it. The original developer would also be working on the original version. We would both save our copy and they would be different and not share the changes that were made by both of the parties. Some people suggest that a fork in the bitcoin could be used. It would take a majority of the miners to approve a different version that will be accepted by the community.\r\n\r\n<b>Alternative Uses</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of people are hoping that bitcoin will be used by the mainstream for daily purchases. I think it will be used by a niche and be very good at what it does. My guess is that it will be used mostly for:\r\n\r\nA store of wealth\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Investment</li>\r\n	<li>Online Micro-purchases</li>\r\n	<li>Online Tipping</li>\r\n	<li>Transfer of wealth between individuals</li>\r\n	<li>Banking &amp; Currency for Undeveloped Countries</li>\r\n	<li>Buying Illegal Goods &amp; Services</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Hot List</b>\r\n\r\nThere could be a hot list added to Bitcoin. If enough miners agreed to update the core code, then  hot list of addresses holding stolen bitcoin could be frozen. This would render them unspendable to make it not so profitable for bad people to steal bitcoin from people. This would be hard to maintain and it should be hard for a person to place addresses in their but it would be beneficial. The original holder of the bitcoin would have to prove that the bitcoin is indeed theres. Once it is on the host list, it would be worth little to nothing. This might even influence some hackers to give the bitcoin back for an agreed small percentage of legal bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Charitable Donations</b>\r\n\r\nWhen you donate money to a 3rd world country, not all of that money reaches there. [todo: find some percentages]. If you wanted to donate $1, probably about $0.10 will reach the hunger child that you wanted to feed. With Bitcoin, it will be possible to donate $1 to starving children and $1 will reach its targeted donation. The implications of what Bitcoin could do for the world are huge. It is a nearly free to use money transfer system. There will be applications where it will be absolutely free to send money. The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\r\n\r\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes. This is currently the case, but it is easy to convert bitcoins to USD and possibly in the future, the IRS might reconsider. NYC is proposing allowing people to pay their parking tickets with bitcoins. This would save the people and the city to save a lot of money in financial fees with credit cards and mailing checks.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime in 2017. This keeps getting cut in half every four years until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. There is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out how much a bitcoin is worth. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. Who could have imagined something like this even 20 years ago? I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there. I use it as my little hobby/work room and it is free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore because of the costs. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoin until they, hopefully, reach higher levels. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. The only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? But, it creates the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Miners Selling Cloud Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years. Since the ASICs for bitcoin mining came into existence over the past couple of years, the computational power for the bitcoin mining computers has doubled every 6 months and it appears as though this doubling every 6 months will continue here on forward.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining Exchange</b>\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahertz, exahertz, zettahertz or yottahertz. Those are real words, too! petahertz means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahertz means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The network is currently around 300,000,000 hertz.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. It will mine, by contributing a certain number of gigahash per second. Providing these gigahash costs electricity. The mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor of difficulty that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. During price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 13,000 times higher than the world 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn’t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. However, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 13,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

It is easy to write a computer program to accept an incoming transfer and then break it up and send a piece of it to several different addresses. The bitcoins that get sent around won\'t have the fees attached to them like what happens in the market now. It is programmable because it is easy to write a program that automatically distributes funds based on actions the users take while using a computer application.\r\n\r\nVisualize this scenario:\r\n<blockquote>A third party wants to accept donations and divide it between several charities. This would be too expensive to do with credit cards and bank transfers. This can\'t be completed or verified immediately either. Now someone will be able to donate $0.25 to their favorite 50 charities that they choose with a click of a button. Each of those charities will be able to receive a half penny. This will only count as one transaction on the blockchain since there can be multiple receiving addresses in a single transaction. It is immediately verified that the charitable addresses received the donation. This can all be done programmatically.</blockquote>\r\nThat is just one demonstration of how it is programmable. There are many other justifications as to why Bitcoin is more programmable than the USD. The USD takes days for transactions to clear and Credit Cards can take up to months before the transaction is cleared and the funds are available to the parties. Most banks and financial institutions have barriers to allowing money to be so easily distributed and utilized via a computer program.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the international community of businesses and individuals to cooperate financially with the current financial instruments available to them. With Bitcoin, essentially any individual or group of individuals can create and maintain their own bank. They can write the programs to do whatever they can imagine with their bitcoins. The program can send and receive funds with the only limit being its\' creators imagination. That is difficult to do with cash. When you send old-fashioned money, you are really just sending a note for your bank to transfer the funds to them. There is a physical presence of that money that needs to be maintained. There is no guarantee of payment with USD until you get the money physically. The Bitcoin you receive is guaranteed to be yours as soon as the financial transaction is verified by the network and recorded on the blockchain. This allows the money to be easily controlled by computer programs. Bitcoin essentially delegates financing to a powerful computer network where the integrity of transactions can\'t be broken.','Bitcoin is Programmable Money','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-is-programmable-money','','','2015-02-01 10:32:14','2015-02-01 10:32:14','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45',0,'post','',0),(46,1,'2015-01-27 00:13:18','2015-01-27 00:13:18','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\" alt=\"bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\n<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\n\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks. These could all be created in a similar fashion. They would cut out the big players that are making a huge cut in users online activities. If a community of servers could solve problems like search, social networks, shopping, almost any human to human interaction that we do with a computer. There could be nodes like “miners” in Bitcoin that would contain the correct answers for user queries. The network could intelligently organize any information and reward the organizers. An open source catalog could contain a valid list of the cheapest products that anybody could purchase. All of the computers would work together to locate the best available products for the lowest price. The network could connect commerce with consumers and cut out the costs of large third parties. The nodes that manage the network would be rewarded with commissions if they behave well. If they try to mess up the results, the rest of the network would find out and cut them out for new traffic immediately. This would be a decentralization of the network. Peer-to-peer networks work great for content sharing and currency, why isn\'t it used for other popular online activities?<strong>\n</strong>\n\n<b>Web 3.0</b>\n\nIt is the internationalization of the web. People of any language will be able to communicate financially as well as through text and audio/video. You will have a store of wealth online that can easily be transferred to others at your whim. You will be free from corporations and governments limiting your freedoms. It will allow computing resources to be used just like a currency.\n\n<b>Online Activities Have Too Many Fees</b>\n\nAn open and distributed network of e-books can be created to allow for publishers to connect directly with their readers. There is no need for corporations to have a monopoly on the system and take huge cuts. Some of the cuts that they take go to pay the banks the fees for their transactions. Bitcoin takes the banks out of the transactions between merchants and consumers. This model of centralized businesses is taking too much of the money away from the the merchants and consumers. The same principle can be applied to advertisements, e-commerce and search engines.\n\n<b>Post E-Finance</b>\n\nWhat happens after technology takes over finance? Is the next sight on politics? Will computers handle international laws just as they are starting to handle international financial transactions? There might be an autonomous system where there are an agreed upon set of laws. The system will be able to monitor all people and enforce the laws. There will be no single person or groups of people that can go around the the international laws. As scary as it sounds, this might be a good thing. The system would be much more efficient than the current system since there are so many loopholes and contradictions in laws across borders.\n\nWill there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what it is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\n\n<b>Bitcoin For Voting &amp; Authority</b>\n\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications. A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to up-vote it and down-vote it. The more up-votes, the more bitcoins the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoins back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population.\n\nIf content gets all down-votes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam. I think those articles could be spotted by requiring at least a few people to see it. Users would have a power attribute. Users that make \"good\" votes could have increased power. Maybe they could upvote by +1, +2 and +3 and downvote -1, -2, -3.\n\nVoters could be shown some guidelines to not downvote a controversial issue. Sometimes a large percentage of the population has bad feelings towards some issues that were illegal or immoral that might now be regarded as legal and moral. Some of the bitcoin generated from the bad content could also be given to the customers that view the content. This could be done with money but the fees might be too high for content creators to put up a deposit. A content creator might only want to <i>and need to</i> put up $0.25 for their content. That would be impossible to do with a credit card. Amateurs might spend years attempting to create good content and want to try to publish it, but they don’t have money to pay for advertising.\n\nThe large search engines are good for organizing content so that people can find it, but they typically favor the same large media outlets. They also place a lot of advertisements that would avert users away from finding their content. This would also entice advertisers to produce better content and pay the users for finding it. That money currently goes to the large search engines and advertisers. And, there is a ton of money going to them - that money could stay between the online services providers and the customers.\n\nThis system would also hurt entities that attempted to make bad content because they would have to fork over some deposit. Add that to all the money that the merchants and customers save from having to “pay” for advertisements. Both the merchants and the customers pay for those advertisements because the merchant relies on the advertisement to reach the customer. The merchant then has to raise the price of the product to make a profit. The customer pays the increased fee.\n\nWhen someone is at shopping sites, the shopping site and banking system take in a large amount of profits from their merchants and customers. A new system could be created that could cut them out. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men really can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks, online social networks, etc... There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the international community.\n\n<b>Opinion</b>\n\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than the current services if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\n\n<b>Alt-coins</b>\n\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it. Bitcoin is already \"the\" digital currency and it would be difficult for an alternative to surpass it.\n\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\n\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be possible. However, the heat giving off from mining could be a valuable resource. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\n\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\n\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits. Bitcoin offers new &amp; improved services over the old.\n\n<b>Crazy Claims</b>\n\nTo claim that Bitcoin can provide all the services of the Banks, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Western Union to name a few sounds crazy, but they all store and exchange wealth. Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth. The part about storing wealth might be argued against since people that bought at $1100 and now it is at $275, but this is probably just a dip in a long-term rising value.','Bitcoin is More than a Virtual Currency','','inherit','open','open','','33-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-27 00:13:18','2015-01-27 00:13:18','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=46',0,'revision','',0),(47,1,'2015-01-20 21:56:23','2015-01-20 21:56:23','<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\r\n\r\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks.

Will there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin For Voting &amp; Authority</b>\r\n\r\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications. A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to upvote it and downvote it. The more upvotes, the more bitcoin the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoin back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population. If it gets all downvotes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam.

One user could create and store the first half of the password and the other user could create and store the second half of the password. This could help parties come into an agreement without as much risk. If one party does not honor their commitments, then the funds are stuck in the wallet forever.

It is easier for a computer program to accept an incoming transfer and then break it up and send a piece of it to several different addresses. The bitcoins that get sent around won\'t have the fees attached to them like what happens in the market now.\r\n\r\nVisualize this scenario:\r\n<blockquote>A third party wants to accept donations and divide it between several charities. This would be too expensive to do with credit cards and bank transfers. They can\'t be done immediately that way either. They can not be immediately verified either. Now someone will be able to donate $0.25 to their favorite 50 charities that they choose. Each of those charities will be able to receive a half penny. This will only count as one transaction on the blockchain since there can be multiple receiving addresses in a single transaction. It is immediately verified that the charitable addresses received the donation. This can all be done programmatically.</blockquote>\r\nThat is just one demonstration of how it is programmable. There are many other justifications as to why Bitcoin is more programmable than the USD. The USD takes days for transactions to clear and Credit Cards can take up to months before the transaction is cleared and the funds are available to the parties. Most banks and financial institutions have barriers to this. It is difficult for the international community of businesses and individuals to cooperate financially with the current financial instruments available to them. Essentially, any individual or group of individuals can create and maintain there own bank. They can write the programs to do whatever they can imagine with those funds. That is difficult to do with cash. When you send money, they are getting a note for your bank to transfer the funds to you. There is a physical presence of that money that needs to be maintained. There is no guarantee of payment with USD until you get the money physically. The Bitcoin you receive is guaranteed to be yours as soon as the financial transaction is verified by the network and recorded on the blockchain. This allows the money to be easily controlled by computer programs. Bitcoin essentially delegates financial markets to computer systems.','Bitcoin is Programmable Money','','inherit','open','open','','45-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 22:10:06','2015-01-20 22:10:06','',45,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=48',0,'revision','',0),(49,1,'2015-01-20 22:59:32','2015-01-20 22:59:32','<strong><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/financial-problems-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/financial-problems-xs.jpg\" alt=\"The decision of financial problems.\" width=\"547\" height=\"365\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Financial Problems</strong>\r\n\r\nThe international community is unable to efficiently &amp; securely make financial transactions with each other. The only technology that is widely available to the masses is provided by large corporations that have high fees, long waiting periods and lots of other restrictions. For example, try to make a $0.50 purchase online from a company in a different nation. The fees are too high for the merchant - the bank will make more than the merchant. The merchant will have to wait a significant amount of time before having 100% possession of the money - it can be as long as 6 months before the credit cards fully confirm a purchase. And, the credit card transaction will probably fail and force you to manually confirm the purchase directly with your credit card company. And, you do not want to upload your checking account information to some foreigners database for a $0.50 purchase or any size purchase. This makes international commerce nearly impossible. It can only be done by a small percentage of large spenders.

The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin For Voting &amp; Authority</b>\r\n\r\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications. A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to upvote it and downvote it. The more upvotes, the more bitcoin the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoin back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population. If it gets all downvotes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam. I think those articles could be spotted by requiring at least a few people see it and they could have a power attribute to the votes. Maybe they could upvote by +1, +2 and +3 and downvote -1, -2, -3. Voters could be shown some guidelines to not downvote a controversial issue. Sometimes a large percentage of the population has bad feelings towards some issues that were illegal or immoral that might now be regarded as legal and moral. Some of the bitcoin generated from the bad content could also be given to the customers that view the content. This could be done with money but the fees might be too high for content creators to put up a deposit. A content creator might only want to <i>and need to</i> put up $0.25 for their content. That would be impossible to do with a credit card. Amateurs might spend years attempting to create good content and want to try to publish it, but they don’t have money to pay for advertising. The large search engines is good for organizing content so that people can find it, but they typically favor the same large media outlets. They also place a lot of advertisements that would avert users away from finding their content. This would also entice advertisers to produce better content and pay the users for finding it. That money currently goes to the large search engines and advertisers. And, there is a ton of money going to them - that money could stay between the merchants and the customers. All of the money that gets paid to the search engines would remain in the pockets of the merchants and the customers. This system would also hurt entities that attempted to make bad content because they would have to fork over all their bitcoin to the customers and merchants. Add that to all the money that the merchants and customers save from having to “pay” for advertisements. Both the merchants and the customers pay for those advertisements because the merchant relies on the advertisement to reach the customer. The merchant then has to raise the price of the product to make a profit. The customer pays the increased fee. When you shop at shopping sites, the shopping site takes in a large amount of profits from their merchants and customers. A new system could be created that cut them out and give those profits directly to the merchants and customers. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks. There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the most efficient 3rd parties.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nA third-party could use Bitcoin to create digital wallets. One user could create and store the first half of the password and the other user could create and store the second half of the password. This could help parties come into an agreement without as much risk. If one party does not honor their commitments, then the funds are stuck in the wallet forever. This could entice both sides of the parties to honor their agreements.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than western union and paypal if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\r\n\r\n<b>Altcoins</b>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it.\r\n\r\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\r\n\r\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be conceivably built. However, the heat giving off from mining is, in my mind, just as a valuable resource as the processing that is going on. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\r\n\r\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\r\n\r\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits. Bitcoin offers new &amp; improved services over the old.\r\n\r\n<b>Crazy Claims</b>\r\n\r\nTo claim that Bitcoin can provide all the services of the Banks, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Western Union to name a few sounds crazy, but they all store and exchange wealth. Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth. The part about storing wealth might be argued against since people that bought at $1100 and now it is at $275, but this is probably just a dip in a long-term rising value.','Bitcoin is More than a Virtual Currency','','inherit','open','open','','33-revision-v1','','','2015-01-21 02:26:02','2015-01-21 02:26:02','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=56',0,'revision','',0),(57,1,'2015-01-21 02:32:05','2015-01-21 02:32:05','','bitcoindynamics','','inherit','open','open','','bitcoindynamics','','','2015-01-21 02:32:05','2015-01-21 02:32:05','',24,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(58,1,'2015-01-21 02:33:03','2015-01-21 02:33:03','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-57\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 30px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics.gif\" alt=\"bitcoindynamics\" width=\"140\" height=\"260\" /></a>Amplification</b>\r\n\r\nA wealthy individual could have a large impact on the market.

This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine. The halving of the block reward that is predicted for around 2016 will make for a price increase of a possible factor of 2. Moore’s law suggests that computing power on a processor doubles every two years. For the ASICs that mine bitcoin, they have doubled every 6 months. This will make it cheaper and cheaper to mine bitcoin until around 2016. However, if the demand for bitcoin increases to a number larger than what the miners are generating and selling, then current bitcoin holders will sell their holding or the price will rise. Buyers will have to be willing to spend the higher amount of cash for a bitcoin or wait for someone to sell at a lower price. Some people depend on selling their bitcoin to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to buy bitcoin. All of these factors will make for a natural market.

The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. The actual price is irrelevant to their use since it is interchangeable with the USD. There are currently only 13.8 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million. There are 8 digits on the left of the dot and 8 digits on the right: \"13,800,000.12345678\". There is plenty of divisibility here. The high prices have a psychological effect on people in both directions - some people like the fact that the price of a single bitcoin is higher rather than there being 13 trillion bitcoins and there only ever being 21 trillion bitcoin. If the dot was shifted to the left 6 places like this 13,800,000,000,000.12 then, it would be fundamentally the same. Some people would prefer this for purely psychological reason.\n\nOnce more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase.

You might ask: \"What are we going to do with all of the old paper currencies?\" Well, we could certainly start building financial museums and someday bring our grandchildren there telling them: \"this is what we used to use when we were young\". Will it be just Bitcoin in the future? Absolutely not! The USD is almost a digital money already. Most transactions are done with credit cards or bank wires, but Bitcoin will have its role to play in the world. The USD is mostly just digits on a screen, anyhow - they are very similar, but Bitcoin has a lot of useful features that the USD does not have. It is possible that the USD will convert to a model that is more similar to Bitcoin, but that would be difficult to accomplish considering the foundations of our financial infrastructure was built on the current properties of the USD. If the USD acquires all the features that Bitcoins has, which it won\'t, will Bitcoin still have a role to play? Yes, I would say - Bitcoin is an extremely powerful <a title=\"Electronic Financial Instruments\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126\">financial instrument</a> that is <a title=\"Bitcoin is Programmable Money\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45\">easily programmable</a>!\r\n\r\nThe current owners of the physical money are not going to need to trade in their old bills. It would be wise for people to diversify their assets in case if the price of a bitcoin rises significantly compared to the USD.\r\n\r\nWill Bitcoin be one of the worlds\' currencies? It absolutely will be - it already has! The real question is: \"how large of a fraction of the pie of currencies will Bitcoin become?\"  Currently, most transactions with the USD and other fiat currencies are already digital. There is not actual physical cash that exists for all of the money that is out there. When someone gets a loan from the bank, they are lending out money that is in their accounts that belong to other people. So, do the people that have the money in their bank accounts also have that money, too? Does the account holder have $100,000 in the bank even though the bank lent that $100,000 to a home owner? That is $200,000 worth of money but only $100,000 in cash actually exists. Banks are required to hold 15% of the \"money\" as physical \"cash\". The rest is insured by the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/\">FDIC</a> (up to a certain amount) if account holders need their cash but the bank does not have it. There is no FDIC insurance for a Bitcoin wallet, but there are exchanges that offer private insurance on their accounts such as <a href=\"http://www.circle.com/\">Circle</a> and <a href=\"http://xapo.com/\">Xapo</a>.\r\n\r\nBank account holders are in fact lending their money to people that are holding debt to the bank. The account holders sometimes get some small amount of interest for the money in their bank accounts - it is not significant; it won\'t keep up with inflation. On top of the potential interest, the banks provide services in exchange for the bank holders\' cash. What would happen if a large number of people went to their banks and took out all of their money? The banks would not have enough. The FDIC insures the accounts so they have to send the money to the banks so they can give them to the account holders. If this happened rapidly, the FDIC would have to get the treasury to print a lot of money to payback the account holders. The people with debt to the bank would owe the bank and the FDIC the money on their loan. The home owner might or might not have a lot of wealth if they have a mortgage on their home. Homes would go way up in USD value since there is more money in circulation - most of them will have fixed rate interest.  The homeowners would benefit because there home would be worth more than what they owe on it but people holding actual money would be hurt because of the inflation.\r\n\r\nHow much would a large influx of investors buying bitcoins affect the financial system? The people that previously had the bitcoins and sold them to the people that took the money out of their banks to buy bitcoins will have a large portion of USD and possibly they will keep a significant portion of these bitcoins. This will potentially displace some of the funds from the banks and their other investments. Most of the USD will end up back in the banks which will, in turn, lend them out and the cycle will continue. Even if Bitcoin went mainstream, it will not cause a financial crisis; it will only open up more opportunity and cause the existing financial infrastructure to be more efficient and competitive. It may cause some obsolete services to go away.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. This will cause the Bitcoin to rise against the USD and it will transfer wealth to Bitcoin holders. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to mostly maintain the current distribution of wealth. Bitcoin has a long way to go to become relevant, but it is <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">growing rapidly</a>. There will be quite a few new millionaires and billionaires if Bitcoin goes mainstream. Bitcoin technology just might be the world\'s next largest international financial system that is widely recognized. Gold is an example of an international transaction system, but it is for the museums &amp; collectors now; it is impractical to use it for transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Receipts of gold\" was the next international transaction system - these receipts were called dollars, but then the dollars got detached from Gold. They then started making receipts for the dollar and transacted the receipts instead of transacting physical dollars - those were checks. They then created the Internet and could send digital receipts of the physical dollars - those were wire transfers and credit/debit cards. The current system is a mixture of  dollars, receipts of dollars and digital receipts of dollars. It is easy to exchange the digital receipts of dollars. Bitcoin is superior to digital receipts of dollars since it is self-contained. There has to be a lot of trust built between the parties when utilizing the current financial model since digital receipts of dollars are worthless unless if they are honored. With Bitcoin, this trust is not needed; once the transaction is complete, the wealth transfer has been honored and it can\'t be reversed. The Bitcoin system enforces integrity: money can only be sent from a wallet if a private key is provided. There is no need for an inefficient central authority to guarantee the integrity of transactions; Bitcoin transactions can be made almost instantly with absolute certainty.','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-replacing-physical-currencies','','http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45','2015-02-02 00:22:46','2015-02-02 00:22:46','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=64',0,'post','',0),(65,1,'2015-01-21 05:45:48','2015-01-21 05:45:48','','replacingbitcoinusd','','inherit','open','open','','replacingbitcoinusd','','','2015-01-21 05:45:48','2015-01-21 05:45:48','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(66,1,'2015-01-21 09:01:03','2015-01-21 09:01:03','<a href=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe use of physical money will be replaced by digital currencies. What are we going to do with all of the old paper currencies? Well, we could certainly start building financial museums. The current owners of the physical money are going to need to trade it in for the newer digital currencies. Will Bitcoin be one of these new currencies? It absolutely will be. How much of a fraction of the pie of digital currencies will Bitcoin become?  Currently, most transactions with the USD and other fiat currencies are already digital. There is hardly actual physical money that exists for all of the money that is out there. If you get a loan from a bank, they are lending out money that is in their accounts that belong to other people. So, do the people that have the money in their bank accounts also have that money? The account holders are in fact lending the money to people that are holding debt to the bank. The account holders do get some small amount of interest for the money in their bank accounts. It is not significant. What would happen if a large number of people went to their banks and took out money to purchase Bitcoin? The banks would not have enough. The FDIC insures the accounts so they have to send the money to the banks so they can give them to the account holders. If this happened rapidly, the FDIC would have to come up with a lot of money to payback the account holders. The people with debt to the bank would now be owned by the bank and the FDIC. The home owner might or might not have a lot of wealth if they have a mortgage on their home. There house would go way up in USD value. However, most of them will have fixed rate interest.  The home owners would then have to get the USD from the account holders that converted their USD to Bitcoin. The people that previously had the bitcoins and sold them to the people that took the money out of their banks to buy bitcoins will have a large portion of USD and possibly they kept a significant portion of their bitcoins. What happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. There will be a lot of transfer of wealth and money moving around. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to maintain some of the current distribution of wealth. Bitcoin technology just might be the world\'s next largest international financial system that is widely recognized. Gold is an example of an international transaction system, but it is for the museums &amp; collectors. Receipts of gold was the next international transaction system.

It is easy to exchange the digital receipts of dollars. However, there has to be a lot of trust built between the parties. With Bitcoin, that trust is not needed. The system enforces transactions and the Bitcoin system is 15,000 times more powerful than the world\'s top 500 supercomputers combined. A transaction can be sent and received with 100% guarantees as long as the Bitcoin system maintains stable. With it\'s extraordinary computing powers, the system will maintain for the foreseeable future and only grow stronger every year. This rate will accelerate also so we will be able to say that it will grow stronger every month and then every week and then every day. We will be able to calculate its growth by the hour. I\'m not talking about the USD price of bitcoins, I am talking about all the dynamics of the system.<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\">\r\n</a>','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','inherit','open','open','','64-revision-v1','','','2015-01-21 09:01:03','2015-01-21 09:01:03','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=66',0,'revision','',0),(67,1,'2015-01-27 08:54:52','2015-01-27 08:54:52','&nbsp;\n\n<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\n\nCredit cards are a pull technology. That is, when you go to purchase a service or product, you are giving your credit card and identification information and then they make a request for funds to your credit card company. The credit card company then authorizes the transaction resulting in the <i>pull transaction</i>. The company and anybody else can make this pull if they have your credit card information With bitcoin, you are sending money to the merchant directly. They don’t even have to authorize you to send them money. This is called a <i>push transaction</i>.\n\n<strong>Irreversible Transactions</strong>\n\nOnce you send bitcoins to an address, there is no undoing this - it is an irreversible transaction. With credit cards and ACH, there is a wait period before the money is sent. Also, the money can only sent to merchants that have shared all of their information with the bank or credit card company. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, then the merchant will not receive the funds from the credit card company. The merchant, in turn, makes up for these losses by raising there prices. The consumer ends up paying for this. The credit card companies also advertise that they offer fraud protection, but it is really the merchant that is being forced to offer the fraud protection.\n\n<b>Centralization vs Decentralization</b>\n\nThere will have to be a balance between centralization and decentralization. Pure centralization would mean there is one large organization that controls everything. Pure decentralization would mean that each person contributes nearly an equal amount of effort to the system. There must be a balance between these two. We can’t go too far in  either direction or we won’t progress with technology. If we start heading in one direction, a revolutionary product will come out that will bring it back in the other direction. Look back at the mainframes - they were a centralized computer system where dumb terminals would connect to them. Then, we switched towards decentralization by having all the processing power in each individual device. More recently, we have gone back in the direction of centralization with cloud services. Bitcoin is a revolutionary service that is leaning towards decentralization - anybody can have a bank on their own computer. In the end, there will be computation going on everywhere - centralized and decentralized.\n\n<b>Risky Owning Lots of Bitcoin</b>\n\nIt is necessary to keep hard copies of large quantities of bitcoins in fire proof safes or in an insured account - otherwise it is a risk and precautions need to be taken. Businesses surrounding safe bitcoin storage are arising. If bitcoins are not stored very carefully, they could be corrupted, lost or stolen. There have been countless tales of people losing bitcoins by computer crashes or having them stolen by hackers. $500,000,000.00, at the time of the theft, were stolen from customers on Mt. Gox.\n\nThe problem of safely storing large amounts of bitcoin will stop some investors from jumping on board right away. They will wait for an easy to understand and secure solution. They want their accounts to be insured by the FDIC. These services are being launched in Q1 2015. There is a market for professionals to advise wealthy individuals in purchasing bitcoin for their investment portfolio and this market will grow exponentially.\n\nIt is very dangerous to hold a large amount of cash since it can be lost or stolen. For Credit Cards, they pass the fraud expenses onto the businesses and customers. The loss is distributed more in CC - with bitcoin, it is more easy for an individual to get targeted and lose a lot. It would be a good general rule that if you have a large sum of bitcoins, then you better know exactly what you are doing or hire someone that knows what they are doing. And, make sure you trust the person that you hire - it would be easy for them to steal your bitcoins. Those bitcoins are almost certainly gone forever.\n\n<b>Banking for All</b>\n\nA high school student will have the power to run his or her own bank. A high school student from a 3rd world country will have the ability to run his or her own bank. 2/3’s of the worlds population does not have access to banking right now. Most of them have or will have mobile phones with internet access. They will be able to use Bitcoin and get access to the same banking systems that the rest of the world. They will be able to make orders for deliveries of items which otherwise might be more difficult.\n\nIn the not too future, drones will be able to deliver items to places around the world. This is not going to happen for many years, but large companies are currently working on drones that deliver items to people’s doorsteps. If this method of delivering goods proves successful, which it will, then drone development will grow exponentially and we will have drones that can deliver anything, anywhere at anytime. Since Bitcoin can be easily used by anyone, anywhere, at any time and for any amount of money, it will align well with an international drone delivery system.\n\nSpaceX and Facebook have been looking to create satellites that will allow everybody on the planet to get on the internet. They will be providing cheap mobile phones for little to no costs. Facebook will be able to monetize the traffic from all the new users, so they have an incentive to move fast on this venture. These new people on the web will probably all be using Bitcoin for their financial needs - it is an international digital currency that allows any two parties anywhere on the planet to immediately exchange wealth for nearly free. I should say free since the costs will be absorbed by 3rd party apps that will monetize the traffic with advertisements.\n\nHistory has never allowed for such a huge leap in financial internationalization before. Gold and the USD came the closest to allowing this so far; Bitcoin is the next chapter in this process. There has already been a confirmed transaction from somebody from North Korea. It is rare and highly illegal for residents of North Korea to make financial contact with anyone outside the country.\n\n<b>Getting People on Board</b>\n\nThe biggest hurdle right now is getting people on board. Bitcoin has a bad name and it sounds like it is from a cartoon. People that never heard about Bitcoin before usually laugh when I try to explain it to them. One way to get people on board is by giving free and/or cheap bitcoins in order to get people to become familiar with the name Bitcoin and build trust in the Bitcoin system. For the average person, a very small amount, maybe $1, should be seeded to individuals that otherwise would not get into Bitcoin. For the wealthy people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. The bitcoins need to be re-distributed from the early adopters to a larger population in order to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream. The early adopters will still benefit because the value of the entire Bitcoin network goes up for each new person that starts using Bitcoin.

For the wealth people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. This would be bad for the early adopters but good to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream.\r\n\r\n<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. A system called Ripple might be able to accomplish this. For Bitcoin to succeed, there will need to be some 3rd party agency that offers services similar to credit cards. People want a spending limit of money that they can pay back by the end of the next 30 day billing cycle just like they do with credit cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted lie TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin is \"Financial Tools\"','','inherit','open','open','','37-revision-v1','','','2015-01-22 19:30:29','2015-01-22 19:30:29','',37,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=68',0,'revision','',0),(69,1,'2015-01-22 19:45:27','2015-01-22 19:45:27','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe value of bitcoins could fall to a low level if there are not a lot of people that used it and they only used it for small transactions. If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire value of bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction value with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were valued at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013. If Bitcoin could grab even 1% of the market, then the price will should go up much higher than it is.\r\n\r\nFor large organizations or individuals that want to trade a billion or more dollars worth of bitcoins, then they would either have to buy about a quarter of all bitcoins in circulation at the current rate. If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.','What Can Bitcoins Be Valued At','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2015-01-22 19:45:27','2015-01-22 19:45:27','',9,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=69',0,'revision','',0),(70,1,'2015-01-23 08:24:03','2015-01-23 08:24:03','','Server_01_Black','','inherit','open','open','','server_01_black','','','2015-01-23 08:24:03','2015-01-23 08:24:03','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(71,1,'2015-01-23 08:24:11','2015-01-23 08:24:11','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\" alt=\"Server_01_Black\" width=\"400\" height=\"71\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Mine Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes if you would enjoy doing it as a hobby. It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. I know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 10 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 08:24:11','2015-01-23 08:24:11','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=71',0,'revision','',0),(72,1,'2015-01-23 08:24:47','2015-01-23 08:24:47','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\" alt=\"Server_01_Black\" width=\"400\" height=\"71\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Rewards</b>\r\n\r\nCurrently, miners are getting a reward for mining. This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime in 2017. This keeps getting cut in half every four years until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. There is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out how much a bitcoin is worth. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. Who could have imagined something like this even 20 years ago? I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there. I use it as my little hobby/work room and it is free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore because of the costs. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoin until they, hopefully, reach higher levels. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. The only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? But, it creates the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Miners Selling Cloud Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years. Since the ASICs for bitcoin mining came into existence over the past couple of years, the computational power for the bitcoin mining computers has doubled every 6 months and it appears as though this doubling every 6 months will continue here on forward.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining Exchange</b>\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahertz, exahertz, zettahertz or yottahertz. Those are real words, too! petahertz means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahertz means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The network is currently around 300,000,000 hertz.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. It will mine, by contributing a certain number of gigahash per second. Providing these gigahash costs electricity. The mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor of difficulty that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. During price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 13,000 times higher than the world 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn’t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. However, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 13,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

The way that it is done is that a hash of a document gets stored at an address on the Block Chain. The hash and date is now stored on the Block Chain for all of eternity. A document could then be verified to have existed on the Block Chain at a future date. This would be good for copyright, wills, deeds, and similar. This would be similar to getting a document notarized. It will have a signature stating that the document existed at a certain date. Courts and other legal entities only accept notarized documents from a certified notary. It would be much easier and cheaper to get a document notarized on the Block Chain. It could then be sent over the internet without creating a printed out copy. That would be excellent for the environment since using electricity and computers is more efficient than paper. Think about how much effort is done to bring paper documents across the country. You could argue that an e-mail is also proof of existence. However, an e-mail is harder to verify and make publicly available. It is certainly not as secure of a method as using the Block Chain. E-mails can be erased from existence fairly easily. A transaction on the Block Chain will never be erased.\n\nHow would using the Block Chain for this affect the price of a bitcoin? I would argue that the more valuable the Block Chain is, the more secure it would become. And, the more secure that it would become, then everything that the Block Chain is used for that is useful would become more valuable. Miners secure the network and receive bitcoin as a reward. If bitcoins are not valuable, miners will not secure the network. The more valuable bitcoins and the Bitcoin network is, then the higher the price of a bitcoin.\n\nAny parties that have an interest in the Block Chain or bitcoins or any technology that utilizes Bitoin will have vested much and would support the system - they would not let it fail. If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will attempt to that in order to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The Block Chain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for encrypted data to be sent over an un-encrypted network. \n\nBitcoin is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s. If someone can have an immutable proof of existence that the whole world can verify, that is huge! Using the Block Chain for this very task is extremely convenient!  I don\'t think Bitcoin or Block Chain will ever go away - it will exist as a historical artifact even after we stop using it. By the time it is obsolete, the human race will have at least inhabited several galaxies. Even then, it may still be useful. It may be one of the longest running and widely used currency, but we can\'t say for certainty just yet. We will have to wait and find out. I would recommend buying a few bitcoins just in case if Bitcoin and the Block Chain take off.','Proof of Existence','','inherit','open','open','','21-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-26 02:03:21','2015-01-26 02:03:21','',21,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=73',0,'revision','',0),(74,1,'2015-01-23 08:50:29','2015-01-23 08:50:29','[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"387\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg\" alt=\"Descartes\" width=\"387\" height=\"575\" /> I Think Therefore I Am[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe blockchain can be used to prove that a document existed at a certain date.

If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire price of all bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction price with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were priced at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013.

Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use it to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people.\n\nBitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain backwards and forward. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. They could track down a network of criminals &amp; terrorists.\n\nI’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this as an excuse to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have to compete besides lowering their rates for their services. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams - very large salaries &amp; bonuses depend on it! If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well ban airplanes since terrorists use them to crash into buildings. If a government bans Bitcoin with that logic, then they ought to start making it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to commit terrorism. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. These related arguments against Bitcoin does not hold up if using reasonable logic.\n\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\n\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins were created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. The anonymity is that the addresses are not associated to anybody. Once the addresses are associated to individuals, then their is no anonymity. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nOnce a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person could possibly be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. It is possible that the bitcoins were legally obtained. It would be wise to keep detailed documentation if you are planning on doing a lot of business with bitcoins. Personally, I would recommend to only purchase bitcoins from a reputable source. If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government.\n\nA court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\n\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities. I’m not sure how far down a chain the US government could seize dollars that originated from an illegal activity, but similar laws might be applied to bitcoin in the future.','Unethical Bitcoin Uses','','inherit','open','open','','31-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-26 23:24:29','2015-01-26 23:24:29','',31,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=77',0,'revision','',0),(78,1,'2015-01-23 10:46:55','2015-01-23 10:46:55','','hool_face_vector','','inherit','open','open','','hool_face_vector','','','2015-01-23 10:46:55','2015-01-23 10:46:55','',31,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hool_face_vector.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(79,1,'2015-01-23 10:48:27','2015-01-23 10:48:27','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hool_face_vector.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-78\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 30px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hool_face_vector.gif\" alt=\"hool_face_vector\" width=\"198\" height=\"283\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Terrorists Use Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nTerrorists use smartphones. Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use to to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people. Bitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. I’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have besides lowering their rates. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams. If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well make it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to hurt people. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. The argument does not hold up.\r\n\r\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\r\n\r\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that.

It provides very valuable services. Bitcoin is not being sold either. The term \"bitcoins\" is a store of value on the Bitcoin network. This store of value can be sent or received by anybody else with a wallet on the Bitcoin network. This transfer of value is the same service that the major credit card companies provide. Yet, Bitcoin provides the service for nearly free or potentially free. Credit card companies charge huge fees to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Take a look at how much Western Union charges to transfer money from person A in one country  to person B from another country.\r\n\r\nThis would be like calling the internet a Ponzi scheme or calling email a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is a protocol. That means it is just a set of standard rules that a network must follow. The rest of the network can verify if any single node is not following the rules and not accept the work that they performed. Data center provide their processing power for a fee to businesses that need a website. E-mail is free for the end user because the companies that are paying for the hosting is also placing ads and making revenues from the users that way. Since Bitcoin is such a useful financial instrument, it can not be a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can’t be selling a useful product. Some people are calling Bitcoin one of the greatest inventions of all time comparing it to the likes of the telephone. To call it a Ponzi scheme is completely inaccurate since it provides so much for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy bitcoins, you are buying a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. The USD is a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. Gold used to be a good store of wealth and excellent to trade for goods and services. However, it is very inefficient to send gold back and forth between people. The US Dollar was a receipt of gold before they detached its value from gold. It was then set by how much money they print and what people can get with the money that they have. Some financial institutions provide services like Bitcoin does, but they charge a large amount of fees to use it. Even if Bitcoin is not successful, it will be a competitor to the current financial markets and force them to lower the prices or risk losing customers. The current institutions might try to make up for their losses by increasing their prices even more. This would, in turn, make more people try to find alternative sources. In the end, I think Bitcoin will be used around the globe and it will force the large financial institutions to lower their prices for their services. The financial institutions must adapt to meet the advancing technology that the human race is discovering. We are currently locked in an old system that a few wealthy individuals control. Bitcoin will free the world from the current monopoly and give the two out of three people on the planet banking that currently do not have it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 11:43:40','2015-01-23 11:43:40','',11,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=81',0,'revision','',0),(82,1,'2015-01-23 11:45:10','2015-01-23 11:45:10','','photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs','','inherit','open','open','','photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs','','','2015-01-23 11:45:10','2015-01-23 11:45:10','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(83,1,'2015-01-23 11:45:20','2015-01-23 11:45:20','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs\" width=\"550\" height=\"364\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI think the price of bitcoin is going to be hovering around the cost to mine a bitcoin for a while, but it will see some spikes and drops. It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy everyday to sustain the market. This is inflation. This is exactly what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half.The number of miners is growing. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it is growing. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. Also, the value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. There are fewer people that are willing to sell the bitcoin for prices any lower. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is huge.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. Once more people see that, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be a lot more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Currently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks, they don\'t want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed. There are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday. It will be the world\'s most valuable banking system. It is the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. It can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd parties that put advertisements in their free wallets that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 11:45:20','2015-01-23 11:45:20','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=83',0,'revision','',0),(84,1,'2015-01-23 12:12:26','2015-01-23 12:12:26','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52\" style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"introducingbitcoinusd\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is a tool to move wealth from old financial institutions to a younger more tech savvy crowd.

The way that it could be done is that someone that has a document get a hash of it and place the hash at an address on the blockchain. The hash and date is now stored on the blockchain for all of eternity. A document could then be verified to have existed on the blockchain at a future date. This would be good for copyright, wills, deeds, and similar. This would be similar to getting a document notarized. It will have a signature stating that the document existed at a certain date. Courts and other legal entities only accept notarized documents from a certified notary. It would be much easier and cheaper to get a document notarized on the blockchain. It could then be sent over the internet without having ever have a printed out copy. That would be excellent for the environment since using electricity and computers is more efficient than paper. Think about how much effort is done to bring paper documents across the country. You could argue that an e-mail is also proof of existence. However, an e-mail is harder to verify and make publicly available. It is certainly not as secure of a method as using the blockchain. E-mails can be erased from existence fairly easily. A transaction on the blockchain will never be erased.\r\n\r\nHow would using the blockchain for this affect the price of a bitcoin? I would argue that the more valuable the blockchain is, the more secure it would become. And, the more secure that it would become, then everything that the blockchain is used for that is useful would become more valuable. Miners secure the network and receive bitcoin as a reward. If the bitcoin is not valuable, miners will not secure the network. Any parties that have an interest in the blockchain or bitcoins or any technology that utilizes Bitoin will have vested much and would support the system - they would not let it fail. If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will do that to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The blockchain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for non-encrypted data to be sent over the network. It is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s. If someone can have an unmalleable proof of existence that the whole world can verify, that is huge! Using the Blockchain for this very task is extremely convenient!  I don\'t think Bitcoin or blockchain will ever go away - it will exist as a historical artifact even after we stop using it. By the time it is obsolete, the human race will have at least inhabited several galaxies. Even then, it may still be useful. It may be one of the longest running and widely used currency, but we can\'t say for certainty just yet. We will have to wait and find out.','Proof of Existence','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 13:01:09','2015-01-23 13:01:09','',21,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=86',0,'revision','',0),(87,1,'2015-01-23 14:19:00','2015-01-23 14:19:00','<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-88\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 25px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-2359962-robot-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Robot\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" />\n\n<b>Based on Computing Power</b>\n\nIt would be difficult to create a new crypto-currency that is as fair as bitcoin because if it did start getting big, the people that were in early will get rewarded more than that got in later on. The big miners would own a lot of the new coins and people with money could buy them. There would be no little guys. I don\'t think any of the alt-coins out right now are going to surpass Bitcoin. There are some interesting alt-coins where the processing is used to solve useful mathematical equations. A currency like Primecoin might get larger since the hashing algorithm also looks for prime numbers and those prime numbers are useful for scientist and engineers.\n\nA new system could not be based on pure randomness for each wallet because whoever has the most wallets would get the most coins. It will end up being a race for whoever has the most computing power because the person with the most computing power could create the most wallets. Bitcoin has a good lead on any new crypto-currency since it has had so much time to mature. Currently, the newcomers with the most hashing power will earn the biggest rewards. If a similar system came out now, then the few major miners would take a majority of the mining reward. It would be a monopoly on the system. It is good that there were some little guys that got in at the beginning of Bitcoin. It is still the beginning of Bitcoin, so there is plenty of room for late stage newcomers.\n\n<b>Proof of Work</b>\n\nProof of Work is the hashing that a miner does to show that a large investment was made to verify the transactions. It is a difficult math problem that needs to be solved by an ASIC. The rest of the nodes then validate the miners work. This is necessary because if there was no proof of work, then there would be bad nodes that would try to manipulate the system. This ensures that there will be no bad actors because it would be expensive to attempt and difficult to achieve. It is easy to verify that a miner did the correct work.\n\nHere is an alternative proof of work that might be effective: a node gains power through validating &amp; processing transactions. The more correct transactions that the node has  verified, the more power it has on the network. As soon as a powerful node is caught making an incorrect transaction, then they would lose power. The network would also correct the inaccurate transaction that the bad node might have attempted to change. The transactions would have to have a maximum of a single unit. This system is feasible and it is not so expensive to operate. If a system like this could verify transactions as Bitcoin does, then Bitcoin could be in trouble since it will take far less computing power. As there are more transactions on Bitcoin, an adaption to the protocol could be made to allow for miners to spend more computing power on validating and processing transactions instead of just hashing to prove they are doing work.\n\nBitcoin would be an ancestor system to any new ones. I think it will always be around. If a new methodology arises then Bitcoin could be adapted to follow it.\n\n<b>Unfair</b>\n\nA lot of people argue that it is unfair that the ownership of all the bitcoins is skewed towards such a small number of people. The miners that provided just a small amount of computing power at the beginning and held onto their bitcoins will have made an extremely large amount of money from a network that other miners are supporting. With the growing computing power that is needed, a newcomer has to provide thousands and thousands of times more hashing than the very first miners back in 2009-2012. With the maturity of bitcoin compared to any other crypto-currency, it would be hard to make another more fair currency. Whoever gets in on the next currency first will have more coins. If the algorithm was designed to not reward so many coins at the beginning, then that would make it more fair for people that come in later. With the price lowering as of early 2015, this should force some of the early adopters to sell some of their bitcoins to others that are interested in joining the market. However, the earliest adopters built the system. It wouldn\'t be here if it wasn\'t for them. Maybe they deserve the rewards.\n\nIn the long run, there will be some early adopters that might join the status of billionaire (USD). Currently, there are 1,645 billionaires in the world. There were 268 newcomers in 2014. There is plenty of room for a few more of them. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has over 1 million bitcoins. When the price of bitcoin surged to over $1,100, Satoshi’s worth was valued over $1 Billion. However, if he tried to sell them all for $1,1000 each or any price, the demand would fall and the price of the bitcoin would fall with it probably right down to $20. I don’t think bitcoin is going to shift the wealth of the world very much. Those early adopters would be better off slowly selling bitcoins over the years. If they sell too many, the price will plummet. If they hold onto them, the price should rise, but it will be lowered once they start to sell them. They will need to sell some of them to live a billionaire lifestyle. - not everybody accepts bitcoin as a payment. Even if they do accept bitcoin as a payment, then the bitcoin will be distributed more. Wealthy people will get their hands on their share of the bitcoin. They have the power to manipulate the bitcoin markets and get it from the early adopters for cheaper than what it will be worth in the future. In the long run, I think the bitcoin will end up mostly in the pockets of the existing rich people. And, it will create a lot of new wealthy people.\n\n<b>Advancement of Processing</b>\n\nBitcoin is speeding up the rate at which computation advances. This has huge impacts on the timelines of predicted processing power. There are 3 important milestones:\n<ol>\n	<li>All the computers on the planet are equivalent to one human brain</li>\n	<li>One computer is equivalent to one human brain</li>\n	<li>One computer is equivalent to all the human brains on the planet</li>\n</ol>\nThis is comparing apples to oranges some would argue, but brains and computer processors are more similar than most people think.

It is a difficult math problem that needs to be solved by an ASIC. The rest of the nodes then validate the miners work. This is necessary because if there was no proof of work, then there would be bad nodes that would try to manipulate the system. This ensures that there will be no bad actors because it would be expensive to attempt and difficult to achieve. An alternative proof of work might be effective. A node gains power through validating transactions. The more correct transactions that the node has  verified, the more power it has on the network. As soon as a powerful node is caught making an incorrect transaction, then they would lose power. The network would also correct the inaccurate transaction The transactions would have to have a maximum of a single unit. This system is feasible and it is not so expensive to operate. If a system like this could verify transactions as Bitcoin does, then Bitcoin could be in trouble. Bitcoin would be an ancestor system and I think it will always be around even for memories sake.\r\n\r\n<b>Unfair</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of people argue that it is unfair that the ownership of all the bitcoins is skewed towards such a small number of people. The miners that provided just a small amount of computing power at the beginning and held onto their bitcoins will have made an extremely large amount of money from a network that other miners are supporting. With the growing computing power that is needed, a newcomer has to provide thousands and thousands of times more hashing than those newcomers. With the maturity of bitcoin compared to any other crypto-currency, it would be hard to make another more fair currency. Whoever gets in on the next currency first will have more coins. If the algorithm was designed to not rewards so many coins at the beginning, then that would make it more fair for people that come in later. With the price lowering as of early 2015, this should force some of the early adopters to sell some of their bitcoins to others that are interested in joining the market.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, there will be some early adopters that might join the status of billionaire (USD). Currently, there are 1,645 billionaires in the world. There were 268 newcomers in 2014. There is plenty of room for a few more of them. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has over 1 million bitcoins. When the price of bitcoin surged to over $1,100, Satoshi’s worth was valued over $1 Billion. However, if he tried to sell them all for $1,1000 each, the demand would fall and the price of the bitcoin would fall with it. I don’t think bitcoin is going to shift the wealth of the world very much. Those early adopters would be better off slowly selling bitcoins over the years. If they sell too many, the price will plummet. If they hold onto them, the price should rise, but it will be lowered once they start to sell them. They will need to sell some of them to live a billionaire lifestyle. Not everybody accepts bitcoin as a payment. Even if they do accept bitcoin as a payment, then the bitcoin will be distributed more. Wealthy people will get their hands on their share of the bitcoin. They have to power to manipulate the bitcoin markets and get it from the early adopters for cheaper than what it will be worth.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. I know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will be printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 5 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and the adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 14:22:21','2015-01-23 14:22:21','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=92',0,'revision','',0),(93,1,'2015-01-24 04:18:11','2015-01-24 04:18:11','','IMAG0416','','inherit','open','open','','imag0416','','','2015-01-24 04:18:11','2015-01-24 04:18:11','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMAG0416.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(94,1,'2015-01-24 21:41:51','2015-01-24 21:41:51','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/computer-security-xs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/computer-security-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Computer security\" width=\"547\" height=\"365\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-209\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt is true that extra security needs to be taken to stop bitcoins from being stolen, but the same problem exists for automobiles. I don\'t think people should not buy or use automobiles because they might get stolen. People could only use trains and buses so they don\'t have to worry about their car being stolen, but a car can be much more convenient than a bus or train. Similarly, bitcoins can be much more convenient than cash or credit cards, however, it is more risky to use Bitoin for now, just like having an automobile is more risky than a train or bus. Credit cards and cash are much more limiting than Bitcoin and credit cards are also more expensive. Buses and trains are typically cheaper than cars, but are very limiting. If the proper precautions are taken, than it is nearly impossible for people to have their bitcoins stolen. <em>There is always a possibility that any possession can be stolen from you!</em> There is a learning curve with Bitcoin, but the advantages for individuals and the collective society to use Bitcoin outweigh the risks that come with using it; the risks of not using Bitcoin are also prevalent - try to make a purchase online for a small amount with your credit card or checking account and you may end up going through a lot of hassles to recover from identity fraud.

It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy in order to sustain the market so price don\'t rapidly decline. Bitcoin mining is inflation. This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half. The number of miners is growing. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. Also, the value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices as you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go down to less than $200 and fewer sell orders until near $400. There are fewer people that are willing to sell the bitcoin for prices any lower. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. Currently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them unless if they owned a significant amount of bitcoins or had stake in a 3rd party Bitcoin app. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed since it is a transfer of wealth and power. There are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. It can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-01-25 03:29:13','2015-01-25 03:29:13','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=96',0,'revision','',0),(97,1,'2015-01-25 05:38:22','2015-01-25 05:38:22','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cost-vs-value.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-98\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cost-vs-value.jpg\" alt=\"Cost-value graph on blackboard\" width=\"511\" height=\"391\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin network is not free - it costs money to run. It is a network of super-computers. The miners, which run the network, get paid with transactions fees and rewards for providing this valuable service. They are currently rewarded with 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes and the transactions - this is the cost of Bitcoin. When I say value, I am not talking about price. Price is how much a bitcoin costs and value is how well of a service Bitcoin offers. The inflation started off at 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes in 2009 when Bitcoin was first launched. This number gets cut in half every 4 years. This \"minting\" or \"mining\" of the bitcoins is inflationary in nature. Every 25 new bitcoins mined will make the rest of the bitcoins worth a little bit less. So, the holders of bitcoins are paying the high transaction fees right now. However, this cost is offset by new-comers buying the newly minted bitcoins, so the current bitcoin holders aren\'t taking 100% of the costs. The transaction fees are negligible right now but they will grow over time and should accumulate with the large quantity of transactions. Around 2140, Bitcoin will stop mining new bitcoins since it gets cut in half every 4 years. This is when the inflation stops. The price of bitcoins should be affected dramatically at the next halving scheduled to happen around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. The supply will be less and if the demand stays the same, then the price of the bitcoins will have to go up. Currently, the price staying high depends on the number of people entering the bitcoin purchasing market. It seems to be maintaining to some extent right now. The price is still around $250 per bitcoin at the time of this writing. The miners are able to sell their bitcoins.

The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The blockchain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon.

It takes the responsibility to print and mint money away from the treasurer. It takes the 3rd parties out of transactions. It allows one user to send money directly to another user basically for free. This website will go over some of the basics of Bitcoin and then go deep into some of the more advanced topics. I will be discussing Bitcoin in relation to the USD and all other financial instruments.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is an international and decentralized network that contains a blockchain with stores of value in it at certain addresses. Just like the USD, Bitcoin provides for a mechanism to store wealth and to make trades. The blockchain contains all of the transactions between these addresses and so much more than that. A user of Bitcoin would need a password and private key to transfer funds from that address. Anybody can send money to the addresses on the Blockchain. The blockchain is also an open network where anybody willing to participate is allowed if they follow the rules. The Blockchain is very complicated and I am only going to give a brief overview of it here at this website.\r\n\r\nIn this website, I will write about some of the most important parts of Bitcoin. I will also give my personal opinion on Bitcoin and go over other peoples opinions. I will discuss everything and anything involving Bitcoin. If you have any topics that you would like me to write about that is related to Bitcoin, please leave a comment below! If I can respond in the comment, I will do that. If your inquiry deserves a full article, then I will write an article.','Introduction','','inherit','open','open','','4-revision-v1','','','2015-01-25 06:49:33','2015-01-25 06:49:33','',4,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=103',0,'revision','',0),(106,1,'2015-01-25 08:37:50','0000-00-00 00:00:00','[todo describe big sales 10,000+ coins etc... and how it would impact price, cause bear or bull, etc... usually don\'t happen because it is smarter to slowly buy or sell coins so a seller can make more or a buyer can get them for less.','Large Bitcoin Sells/Buys','','draft','open','open','','','','','2015-01-25 08:37:50','2015-01-25 08:37:50','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=106',0,'post','',0),(108,1,'2015-01-26 01:40:27','2015-01-26 01:40:27','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8473648-boss-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8473648-boss-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Boss\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBy no means can Bitcoin be labeled as a Ponzi scheme. It provides very valuable services. Bitcoin is not being sold either. The term \"bitcoins\" is a store of value on the Bitcoin network. This store of value can be sent or received by anybody else with a wallet on the Bitcoin network. This transfer of value is the same service that the major credit card companies provide. Yet, Bitcoin provides the service for nearly free or potentially free. Credit card companies charge huge fees to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Take a look at how much Western Union charges to transfer money from person A in one country  to person B from another country.\r\n\r\nThis would be like calling the internet a Ponzi scheme or calling email a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is a protocol. That means it is just a set of standard rules that a network must follow. The rest of the network can verify if any single node is not following the rules and not accept the work that they performed. Data center provide their processing power for a fee to businesses that need a website. E-mail is free for the end user because the companies that are paying for the hosting is also placing ads and making revenues from the users that way. Since Bitcoin is such a useful financial instrument, it can not be a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can’t be selling a useful product. Some people are calling Bitcoin one of the greatest inventions of all time comparing it to the likes of the telephone. To call it a Ponzi scheme is completely inaccurate since it provides so much for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy bitcoins, you are buying a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. The USD is a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. Gold used to be a good store of wealth and excellent to trade for goods and services. However, it is very inefficient to send gold back and forth between people. The US Dollar was a receipt of gold before they detached its value from gold. It was then set by how much money they print and what people can get with the money that they have. Some financial institutions provide services like Bitcoin does, but they charge a large amount of fees to use it. Even if Bitcoin is not successful, it will be a competitor to the current financial markets and force them to lower the prices or risk losing customers. \r\n\r\nThe current institutions might try to make up for their losses by increasing their prices even more. This would, in turn, make more people try to find alternative sources. In the end, I think Bitcoin will be used around the globe and it will force the large financial institutions to lower their prices for their services. The financial institutions must adapt to meet the advancing technology that the human race is discovering. We are currently locked in an old system that a few wealthy individuals control. Bitcoin will free the world from the current monopoly and give the two out of three people on the planet banking that currently do not have it.','Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 01:40:27','2015-01-26 01:40:27','',11,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=108',0,'revision','',0),(109,1,'2015-01-26 01:42:50','2015-01-26 01:42:50','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\" alt=\"Server_01_Black\" width=\"400\" height=\"71\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Mine Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes if you would enjoy doing it as a hobby. It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. \r\n\r\nI know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will be printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 5 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and the adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 01:42:50','2015-01-26 01:42:50','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=109',0,'revision','',0),(110,1,'2015-01-26 01:50:06','2015-01-26 01:50:06','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs\" width=\"550\" height=\"364\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI think the price of a bitcoin is going to be hovering around the cost to mine a bitcoin for a while, but it will see some spikes and drops. It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy in order to sustain the market so price don\'t rapidly decline. Bitcoin mining is inflation. This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half. \r\n\r\nThe number of miners is growing at a rapid pace. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it constantly growing over time so every week it reaches another all time high. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. The value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. That might be partly a reason for the declines in 2014. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. Currently, you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go about 25% down from the going rate. There are fewer sell orders until about 50% above going rate. So, more people are ready to buy then there are to sell as of the writing of this article. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate. This computing power will be directly proportional to the going rate. Over the long run, you can see that both the computer power and price have steadily grown since 2009.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. \r\n\r\nCurrently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them unless if they owned a significant amount of bitcoins or had stake in a 3rd party Bitcoin app. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed since it is a transfer of wealth and power. \r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. \r\n\r\nBitcoin can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 01:50:06','2015-01-26 01:50:06','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=110',0,'revision','',0),(111,1,'2015-01-26 01:50:29','2015-01-26 01:50:29','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe value of bitcoins could fall to a low level if there are not a lot of people that used it and they only used it for small transactions.

The way the buys and sells are setup is that people make a bid to buy or sell a certain number of bitcoin at a certain price. There are only so many bitcoins listed on the market. If someone wanted to buy 10,000 bitcoins, then they would not be able to buy that many at the current market rates. There might only be 100 listed within +1% of current price, 1000 withing +5% of current price and 10,000 within +20% of current price. \r\n\r\nIf they wanted 10,000 bitcoins, then they would have to buy some of those bitcoin from sellers that list their price at higher than the current market rate. This would in turn bring the rate up. A single exchange might not be able to handle that many bitcoin. The wealthy individual would be better off buying 1,000 bitcoin from each of the major exchanges. They would need to buy a percentage of these bitcoins each day over a longer period of time in order to not cause a spike in the price. However, they would risk that the price goes into a temporary bubble or a longer term increase in price and they would end up paying more for the bitcoins then they would have if they just bought 10,000 outright. The market is extremely volatile! There would need to be a carefully planned entry into the market for these individuals to get a maximum amount of bitcoin for the most minimal price possible. There would be no perfect solution for this. It is a gamble on the unknown of the market.\r\n\r\n<b>High Prices</b>\r\n\r\nThe high price of bitcoins are making it so average people will not buy or use Bitcoin. The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. The actual price is irrelevant to their use since it is interchangeable with the USD. There are currently only 13.8 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million. There are 8 digits on the left of the dot and 8 digits on the right: \"13,800,000.12345678\". There is plenty of divisibility here. The high prices have a psychological effect on people in both directions - some people like the fact that the price of a single bitcoin is higher rather than there being 13 trillion bitcoins and there only ever being 21 trillion bitcoin. If the dot was shifted to the left 6 places like this 13,800,000,000,000.12 then, it would be fundamentally the same. Some people would prefer this for purely psychological reason.\r\n\r\nOnce more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase. Once the value of the market increases, bitcoins will have a higher price tag. The price will find an equilibrium between this and an uncountable (maybe countable) number of other factors. The price to mine a bitcoin will be factored into the price. Why would someone pay $400 for a bitcoin when they can mine one for $300 or less? The price to mine a bitcoin has been decreasing. This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine. The halving of the block reward that is predicted for around 2016 will make for a price increase of a possible factor of 2. \r\n\r\nMoore’s law suggests that computing power on a processor doubles every two years. For the ASICs that mine bitcoin, they have doubled every 6 months. This has huge implications in of itself! This will make it cheaper and cheaper to mine bitcoin. However, if the demand for bitcoins increases to a number larger than what the miners are generating and selling, then current bitcoin holders will sell their holding or the price will rise significantly. Buyers will have to be willing to spend the higher amount of cash for a bitcoin or wait for someone to sell at a lower price. That might not ever happen. Some people depend on selling their bitcoins to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to sell - they are forced to sell at low prices. All of these factors will make for a natural & free market. There could be short-lived crashes and bubbles, but I think the price will stay at around the price of mining with the supply &amp; demand factored into some complex equation.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot Commodity</b>\r\n\r\nPeople will want to get into Bitcoin. They have seen the potential. The psychological effect of 1 bitcoin is going to have an impact on the price of a bitcoin since there are only 14 million bitcoins now and there will never be more than 21 million. It wouldn\'t be hard to see a market of millions of people in Bitcoin in the near future. A significant number of people will, psychologically, want at least one whole bitcoin. It will be a milestone. Investment firms are hiring people specializing in Bitcoin. This will attract wealthy individuals that want more than just one bitcoin. They will be pitching Bitcoin to investors that have large quantities of money and to average people. Some of them will want to buy one, tens, hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of bitcoins or more. Bitcoin is a very powerful network that is capable of scaling to handle a large portion of national and international transactions for a much cheaper price than what is currently available.

If someone wanted to buy 10,000 bitcoins, then they would not be able to buy that many at the current market rates. There might only be 100 listed within +1% of current price, 1000 withing +5% of current price and 10,000 within +20% of current price. \r\n\r\nIf they wanted 10,000 bitcoins, then they would have to buy some of those bitcoin from sellers that list their price at higher than the current market rate. This would in turn bring the rate up. A single exchange might not be able to handle that many bitcoins without the price skyrocketing to +100% of current market rate. The wealthy individual would be better off buying 1,000 bitcoins from each of the major exchanges. They would need to buy a percentage of these bitcoins each day over a longer period of time in order to not cause a spike in the price. However, they would risk that the price goes into a temporary bubble or a longer term increase in price and they would end up paying more for the bitcoins then they would have if they just bought 10,000 outright. The market is extremely volatile! There would need to be a carefully planned entry into the market for these individuals to get a maximum amount of bitcoin for the most minimal price possible. There would be no perfect solution for this. It is a gamble on the unknown of the market.\r\n\r\n<b>High Prices</b>\r\n\r\nThe high price of bitcoins are making it so average people will not buy or use Bitcoin. The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. The actual price is irrelevant to their use since it is interchangeable with the USD. There are currently only 13.8 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million. There are 8 digits on the left of the dot and 8 digits on the right: \"13,800,000.12345678\". There is plenty of divisibility here. The high prices have a psychological effect on people in both directions - some people like the fact that the price of a single bitcoin is higher rather than there being 13 trillion bitcoins and there only ever being 21 trillion bitcoin. If the dot was shifted to the left 6 places like this 13,800,000,000,000.12 then, it would be fundamentally the same. Some people would prefer this for purely psychological reason.\r\n\r\nOnce more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase. Once the value of the market increases, bitcoins will have a higher price tag. The price will find an equilibrium between this and an uncountable (maybe countable) number of other factors. The price to mine a bitcoin will be factored into the price. Why would someone pay $400 for a bitcoin when they can mine one for $300 or less? The price to mine a bitcoin has been decreasing. This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine. The halving of the block reward that is predicted for around 2016 will make for a price increase of a possible factor of 2. \r\n\r\nMoore’s law suggests that computing power on a processor doubles every two years. For the ASICs that mine bitcoin, they have doubled every 6 months. This has huge implications in of itself! This will make it cheaper and cheaper to mine bitcoin. However, if the demand for bitcoins increases to a number larger than what the miners are generating and selling, then current bitcoin holders will sell their holding or the price will rise significantly. Buyers will have to be willing to spend the higher amount of cash for a bitcoin or wait for someone to sell at a lower price. That might not ever happen. Some people depend on selling their bitcoins to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to sell - they are forced to sell at low prices. All of these factors will make for a natural & free market. There could be short-lived crashes and bubbles, but I think the price will stay at around the price of mining with the supply &amp; demand factored into some complex equation.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot Commodity</b>\r\n\r\nPeople will want to get into Bitcoin. They have seen the potential. The psychological effect of 1 bitcoin is going to have an impact on the price of a bitcoin since there are only 14 million bitcoins now and there will never be more than 21 million. It wouldn\'t be hard to see a market of millions of people in Bitcoin in the near future. A significant number of people will, psychologically, want at least one whole bitcoin. It will be a milestone. Investment firms are hiring people specializing in Bitcoin. This will attract wealthy individuals that want more than just one bitcoin. They will be pitching Bitcoin to investors that have large quantities of money and to average people. Some of them will want to buy one, tens, hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of bitcoins or more. Bitcoin is a very powerful network that is capable of scaling to handle a large portion of national and international transactions for a much cheaper price than what is currently available. It will be a great asset that should increase in value & price.','Bitcoin Dynamics','','inherit','open','open','','24-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 18:03:33','2015-01-26 18:03:33','',24,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=117',0,'revision','',0),(119,1,'2015-01-26 20:08:22','2015-01-26 20:08:22','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\" alt=\"Server_01_Black\" width=\"400\" height=\"71\" /></a>\n\n<b>Mining Rewards</b>\n\nCurrently, miners are getting a reward for mining. This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. This process of halving continues until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. However, there is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market. Learn more about the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">Costs of Bitcoin</a> paid through inflation and transaction fees.\n\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\n\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9\">price of a bitcoin</a>. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. This is about a half a watt of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially. I would not be surprised to see rates of 0.01 W/GH/s in a few years from now. Moore\'s law states that processing power doubles every 18 months - the processing power for ASIC miners for Bitcoin doubles every 6 months. This time for doubling is shrinking. We could see doubling of processing power every month at some point in the future. Most people predicted that Moore\'s law would slow down, but this might not be the case. However, there are some physical limitations in our universe that will prevent us from further increasing processing power. I would say the most extreme limitation is the speed of light.\n\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\n\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? It does create the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing surrounding Bitcoin mining. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\n\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\n\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi-attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there during the winter months. I use it as my little hobby/work room and the miners now provide, basically, free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoins until they, hopefully, reach much higher prices. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. I did buy them with a credit card on a 0% APR promotion so I would not have been able to purchase the bitcoins directly with my credit card as I can with the mining hardware. I will also be able to, hopefully, sell the miners in May when the warm weather approaches. This makes mining profitable for my specific case. \n\nTypically, the only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\n\n<b>Cloud Mining & Exchanges</b>\n\nMiners can potentially make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that Moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years.\n\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\n\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\n\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahash, exahash, zettahash or yottahash. Those are real words, too! petahash means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahash means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\n\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\n\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. \n\nThe mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. \n\nDuring price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 15,000 times higher than the world\'s 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn\'t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. \n\nHowever, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\n\nIt is the duty of nations to protect its\' citizens assets and interests. Citizens from many nations have vested interest in Bitcoin. An attack on the Bitcoin network by individuals will be regarded as an act of terrorism against all the countries who have citizens that are vested in Bitcoin. Nations would be obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. If a nation attacke\n\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\n\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 13,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. This process of halving continues until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. However, there is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market. Learn more about the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">Costs of Bitcoin</a> paid through inflation and transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9\">price of a bitcoin</a>. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. This is about a half a watt of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially. I would not be surprised to see rates of 0.01 W/GH/s in a few years from now. Moore\'s law states that processing power doubles every 18 months - the processing power for ASIC miners for Bitcoin doubles every 6 months. This time for doubling is shrinking. We could see doubling of processing power every month at some point in the future. Most people predicted that Moore\'s law would slow down, but this might not be the case. However, there are some physical limitations in our universe that will prevent us from further increasing processing power. I would say the most extreme limitation is the speed of light.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? It does create the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing surrounding Bitcoin mining. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi-attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there during the winter months. I use it as my little hobby/work room and the miners now provide, basically, free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoins until they, hopefully, reach much higher prices. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. I did buy them with a credit card on a 0% APR promotion so I would not have been able to purchase the bitcoins directly with my credit card as I can with the mining hardware. I will also be able to, hopefully, sell the miners in May when the warm weather approaches. This makes mining profitable for my specific case. \r\n\r\nTypically, the only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining & Exchanges</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can potentially make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that Moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years.\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahash, exahash, zettahash or yottahash. Those are real words, too! petahash means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahash means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. \r\n\r\nThe mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. \r\n\r\nDuring price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 15,000 times higher than the world\'s 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn\'t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. \r\n\r\nHowever, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of nations to protect its\' citizens assets and interests. Citizens from many nations have vested interest in Bitcoin. An attack on the Bitcoin network by individuals will be regarded as an act of terrorism against all the countries who have citizens that are vested in Bitcoin. Nations would be obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. If a nation attacked the Bitcoin network, it will be viewed as an act of cyber-warfare against many nations at once. People argue that the Bitcoin can\'t be legitimate because there is no nation that backs it. However, there are many nations that back it. It already has more backing by more nations than any other currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 15,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use it to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain backwards and forward. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. They could track down a network of criminals &amp; terrorists.\r\n\r\nI’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this as an excuse to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have to compete besides lowering their rates for their services. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams - very large salaries &amp; bonuses depend on it! If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well ban airplanes since terrorists use them to crash into buildings. If a government bans Bitcoin with that logic, then they ought to start making it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to commit terrorism. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. These related arguments against Bitcoin does not hold up if using reasonable logic.\r\n\r\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\r\n\r\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins were created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. The anonymity is that the addresses are not associated to anybody. Once the addresses are associated to individuals, then their is no anonymity. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nOnce a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person could possibly be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. It is possible that the bitcoins were legally obtained. It would be wise to keep detailed documentation if you are planning on doing a lot of business with bitcoins. Personally, I would recommend to only purchase bitcoins from a reputable source. If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government.\r\n\r\n<strong>Court Orders</strong>\r\n\r\nA court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\r\n\r\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities. I’m not sure how far down a chain the US government could seize dollars that originated from an illegal activity, but similar laws might be applied to bitcoin in the future.','Unethical Bitcoin Uses','','inherit','open','open','','31-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 23:24:55','2015-01-26 23:24:55','',31,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=122',0,'revision','',0),(123,1,'2015-01-27 00:14:35','2015-01-27 00:14:35','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\" alt=\"bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\r\n\r\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks. These could all be created in a similar fashion. They would cut out the big players that are making a huge cut in users online activities. If a community of servers could solve problems like search, social networks, shopping, almost any human to human interaction that we do with a computer. There could be nodes like “miners” in Bitcoin that would contain the correct answers for user queries. The network could intelligently organize any information and reward the organizers. An open source catalog could contain a valid list of the cheapest products that anybody could purchase. All of the computers would work together to locate the best available products for the lowest price. The network could connect commerce with consumers and cut out the costs of large third parties. The nodes that manage the network would be rewarded with commissions if they behave well. If they try to mess up the results, the rest of the network would find out and cut them out for new traffic immediately. This would be a decentralization of the network. Peer-to-peer networks work great for content sharing and currency, why isn\'t it used for other popular online activities?<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Web 3.0</b>\r\n\r\nIt is the internationalization of the web. People of any language will be able to communicate financially as well as through text and audio/video. You will have a store of wealth online that can easily be transferred to others at your whim. You will be free from corporations and governments limiting your freedoms. It will allow computing resources to be used just like a currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Online Activities Have Too Many Fees</b>\r\n\r\nAn open and distributed network of e-books can be created to allow for publishers to connect directly with their readers. There is no need for corporations to have a monopoly on the system and take huge cuts. Some of the cuts that they take go to pay the banks the fees for their transactions. Bitcoin takes the banks out of the transactions between merchants and consumers. This model of centralized businesses is taking too much of the money away from the the merchants and consumers. The same principle can be applied to advertisements, e-commerce and search engines.\r\n\r\n<b>Post E-Finance</b>\r\n\r\nWhat happens after technology takes over finance? Is the next sight on politics? Will computers handle international laws just as they are starting to handle international financial transactions? There might be an autonomous system where there are an agreed upon set of laws. The system will be able to monitor all people and enforce the laws. There will be no single person or groups of people that can go around the the international laws. As scary as it sounds, this might be a good thing. The system would be much more efficient than the current system since there are so many loopholes and contradictions in laws across borders.\r\n\r\nWill there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what it is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than the current services if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\r\n\r\n<b>Alt-coins</b>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it. Bitcoin is already \"the\" digital currency and it would be difficult for an alternative to surpass it.\r\n\r\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\r\n\r\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be possible. However, the heat giving off from mining could be a valuable resource. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\r\n\r\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\r\n\r\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits. Bitcoin offers new &amp; improved services over the old.\r\n\r\n<b>Crazy Claims</b>\r\n\r\nTo claim that Bitcoin can provide all the services of the Banks, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Western Union to name a few sounds crazy, but they all store and exchange wealth. Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth. The part about storing wealth might be argued against since people that bought at $1100 and now it is at $275, but that was an artificial spike and prices are correcting themselves to their true worth.','Bitcoin is More than a Virtual Currency','','inherit','open','open','','33-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 00:14:35','2015-01-27 00:14:35','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=123',0,'revision','',0),(124,1,'2015-01-27 00:16:30','2015-01-27 00:16:30','<b>Proposed System</b>\r\n\r\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications.

A new system could be created that could cut them out. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men really can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks, online social networks, etc... There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the international community.','Bitcoin Deposits to Ensure Quality Content','','inherit','open','open','','124-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 00:16:30','2015-01-27 00:16:30','',124,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=125',0,'revision','',0),(126,1,'2015-01-27 08:52:47','2015-01-27 08:52:47','<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth.

This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. A system called Ripple might be able to accomplish this. For Bitcoin to succeed, there will need to be some 3rd party agency that offers services similar to credit cards. People want a spending limit of money that they can pay back by the end of the next 30 day billing cycle just like they do with credit cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted lie TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','inherit','open','open','','126-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 08:52:47','2015-01-27 08:52:47','',126,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=127',0,'revision','',0),(128,1,'2015-01-27 08:57:23','2015-01-27 08:57:23','Finance Background as a Creative Concept Art','Finance','','inherit','open','open','','finance','','','2015-01-27 08:57:23','2015-01-27 08:57:23','',37,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(129,1,'2015-01-27 08:57:34','2015-01-27 08:57:34','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-128\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg\" alt=\"Finance\" width=\"556\" height=\"360\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\r\n\r\nCredit cards are a pull technology. That is, when you go to purchase a service or product, you are giving your credit card and identification information and then they make a request for funds to your credit card company. The credit card company then authorizes the transaction resulting in the <i>pull transaction</i>. The company and anybody else can make this pull if they have your credit card information With bitcoin, you are sending money to the merchant directly. They don’t even have to authorize you to send them money. This is called a <i>push transaction</i>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Irreversible Transactions</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you send bitcoins to an address, there is no undoing this - it is an irreversible transaction. With credit cards and ACH, there is a wait period before the money is sent. Also, the money can only sent to merchants that have shared all of their information with the bank or credit card company. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, then the merchant will not receive the funds from the credit card company. The merchant, in turn, makes up for these losses by raising there prices. The consumer ends up paying for this. The credit card companies also advertise that they offer fraud protection, but it is really the merchant that is being forced to offer the fraud protection.\r\n\r\n<b>Centralization vs Decentralization</b>\r\n\r\nThere will have to be a balance between centralization and decentralization. Pure centralization would mean there is one large organization that controls everything. Pure decentralization would mean that each person contributes nearly an equal amount of effort to the system. There must be a balance between these two. We can’t go too far in  either direction or we won’t progress with technology. If we start heading in one direction, a revolutionary product will come out that will bring it back in the other direction. Look back at the mainframes - they were a centralized computer system where dumb terminals would connect to them. Then, we switched towards decentralization by having all the processing power in each individual device. More recently, we have gone back in the direction of centralization with cloud services. Bitcoin is a revolutionary service that is leaning towards decentralization - anybody can have a bank on their own computer. In the end, there will be computation going on everywhere - centralized and decentralized.\r\n\r\n<b>Risky Owning Lots of Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep hard copies of large quantities of bitcoins in fire proof safes or in an insured account - otherwise it is a risk and precautions need to be taken. Businesses surrounding safe bitcoin storage are arising. If bitcoins are not stored very carefully, they could be corrupted, lost or stolen. There have been countless tales of people losing bitcoins by computer crashes or having them stolen by hackers. $500,000,000.00, at the time of the theft, were stolen from customers on Mt. Gox.\r\n\r\nThe problem of safely storing large amounts of bitcoin will stop some investors from jumping on board right away. They will wait for an easy to understand and secure solution. They want their accounts to be insured by the FDIC. These services are being launched in Q1 2015. There is a market for professionals to advise wealthy individuals in purchasing bitcoin for their investment portfolio and this market will grow exponentially.\r\n\r\nIt is very dangerous to hold a large amount of cash since it can be lost or stolen. For Credit Cards, they pass the fraud expenses onto the businesses and customers. The loss is distributed more in CC - with bitcoin, it is more easy for an individual to get targeted and lose a lot. It would be a good general rule that if you have a large sum of bitcoins, then you better know exactly what you are doing or hire someone that knows what they are doing. And, make sure you trust the person that you hire - it would be easy for them to steal your bitcoins. Those bitcoins are almost certainly gone forever.\r\n\r\n<b>Banking for All</b>\r\n\r\nA high school student will have the power to run his or her own bank. A high school student from a 3rd world country will have the ability to run his or her own bank. 2/3’s of the worlds population does not have access to banking right now. Most of them have or will have mobile phones with internet access. They will be able to use Bitcoin and get access to the same banking systems that the rest of the world. They will be able to make orders for deliveries of items which otherwise might be more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the not too future, drones will be able to deliver items to places around the world. This is not going to happen for many years, but large companies are currently working on drones that deliver items to people’s doorsteps. If this method of delivering goods proves successful, which it will, then drone development will grow exponentially and we will have drones that can deliver anything, anywhere at anytime. Since Bitcoin can be easily used by anyone, anywhere, at any time and for any amount of money, it will align well with an international drone delivery system.\r\n\r\nSpaceX and Facebook have been looking to create satellites that will allow everybody on the planet to get on the internet. They will be providing cheap mobile phones for little to no costs. Facebook will be able to monetize the traffic from all the new users, so they have an incentive to move fast on this venture. These new people on the web will probably all be using Bitcoin for their financial needs - it is an international digital currency that allows any two parties anywhere on the planet to immediately exchange wealth for nearly free. I should say free since the costs will be absorbed by 3rd party apps that will monetize the traffic with advertisements.\r\n\r\nHistory has never allowed for such a huge leap in financial internationalization before. Gold and the USD came the closest to allowing this so far; Bitcoin is the next chapter in this process. There has already been a confirmed transaction from somebody from North Korea. It is rare and highly illegal for residents of North Korea to make financial contact with anyone outside the country.\r\n\r\n<b>Getting People on Board</b>\r\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle right now is getting people on board. Bitcoin has a bad name and it sounds like it is from a cartoon. People that never heard about Bitcoin before usually laugh when I try to explain it to them. One way to get people on board is by giving free and/or cheap bitcoins in order to get people to become familiar with the name Bitcoin and build trust in the Bitcoin system. For the average person, a very small amount, maybe $1, should be seeded to individuals that otherwise would not get into Bitcoin. For the wealthy people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. The bitcoins need to be re-distributed from the early adopters to a larger population in order to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream. The early adopters will still benefit because the value of the entire Bitcoin network goes up for each new person that starts using Bitcoin.

This revolutionary technology allows a college student living off student loans the ability to build useful financial applications that can be used by the masses. Before Bitcoin, only the elitist wealthy owners of financial institutions had this ability. Now, anybody can create a revolutionary app to manage financial affairs. This the WWW all over. It is the beginning of a new era like the revolution that happened with smart phones. This one is bigger than the smart phones because Bitcoin has some fierce and powerful competitors. There was no competition for smartphones - well, land lines? Cellphones evolved into smartphones so they are one and the same instead of being a competitor. The WWW had no competitor. The old in store commerce did not even see the threat of e-commerce until it was too late. The people that we will be taking business from are the most wealthy and powerful people. It is the top 1%. It is the top .1% and even higher. They have control of media and they influence what the general population sees and thinks. This is going to be a battle for this new business. The huge transaction fees that banks are bringing in are up for grabs. Whoever creates the new \"killer apps\" can get super wealthy in a short period of time. It won\'t take much. Think about what happened with social networking and Facebook. The killer apps that will be taking the electronic financial market by storm are in development and some have already been launched. Besides the financial market, the blockchain has uses outside financial transactions. It works as a proof of existence: store a hash of a file on the blockchain to prove that the file existed at a certain time. This can be done programatically - someone that wants to put 1,000,000 proofs of existence on the blockchain can easily write a program to accomplish that task. This public ledger of information is immutable, that is, it can not be changed once it is verified and written to a block. This transaction will be a part of history. The transaction will exist for all time.','Bitcoin is Revolutionary','','inherit','open','open','','84-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 17:58:27','2015-01-27 17:58:27','',84,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=131',0,'revision','',0),(132,1,'2015-01-27 18:03:20','2015-01-27 18:03:20','<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Gc2en3nHxA4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nBitcoin takes the bankers out of banking.

If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','inherit','open','open','','126-revision-v1','','','2015-01-29 06:19:22','2015-01-29 06:19:22','',126,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=134',0,'revision','',0),(135,1,'2015-01-29 06:33:11','2015-01-29 06:33:11','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs\" width=\"522\" height=\"382\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-137\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers will need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. For Bitcoin to succeed, there will need to be some 3rd party agency that offers services similar to credit cards. People want a spending limit of money that they can pay back by the end of the next 30 day billing cycle just like they do with credit cards. They want the 60 day grace period on their balance they don\'t have to pay interest right away. This is a major blocking factor for Bitcoin to go mainstream. Once a reputable company can provide users that have good or excellent credit with a spending limit, then this barrier will be broken. This would open the door to thousands or even millions of new users.\r\n\r\nWith Bitcoin, you will not, anytime soon, get the same 0% APR for 18 months with a $10,000 limit as easily as you currently can with the major credit card issuers. People would rather spend money that they don’t have than to pay immediately with the money that they do have. Most people have debt that they would rather put that money towards so they don’t have to pay interest on it. This gets a lot of people in financial trouble, but it just the way that it is. Hopefully, there will be Bitcoin credit cards where people with excellent credit can get a 10 bitcoin credit where they must pay back just like they do with current credit cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted as a verification of a users agreement to pay them back. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history, then this would provide for a major breakthrough. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to give someone a credit limit in US dollars and allow the user to convert it to bitcoins as needed. This could then be reported to the the standard credit reporting agencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Status</b>\r\n\r\nThere is a company called <a href=\"http://www.btcjam\">BTCJam</a> that allows users to lend their bitcoins to other users. The borrowers will repay the bitcoins they borrowed plus an agreed upon interest rate. The credit history is internal to the system. The borrowers will have their online profiles like Facebook & PayPal verified. They also allow them to have a credit card and checking account that can be verified. If a user has all of these verified, they should be more trustworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not meet the requirements of what is needed for Bitcoin to go mainstream. They need a serious player that will verify credit history on their credit report and report spending to the credit reporting agencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Further Ideas</b>\r\n\r\nAn identity could be linked to a wallet and a users spending could be made available to creditors.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoins, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some at fair market rate. The price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. The price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoins - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoins ever and there is currently about 14,000,000 as of early 2015. Most bitcoins have already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoins per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoins per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoins - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with Bitcoin since bitcoins are fluid. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\n\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\n\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even in virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency that can be used for real tangible products. A two-way virtual currency is one that can be converted from USD and back. Most virtual currencies are one way - you can trade USD for the virtual currency but you can\'t trade the virtual currency for USD. Bitcoin is different since it has so many uses.\n\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\n\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have not yet been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be innovative products that will allow Bitcoin to be used more conveniently than the USD is used.\n\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\n\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount of wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers” or just lucky. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering. Some individuals that have large amounts of bitcoins could become billionaires if Bitcoin goes main stream. You can view the <a href=\"http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100\">BitcoinRichList</a>. The numbers are actually worse than what is displayed at that website. Most large holders of bitcoins have their bitcoins spread out among many different addresses. There are a small number of people that own a large percentage of the bitcoins. This is also true for most currencies and stocks.\n\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\n\nPeople have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current payment methods illegal? They could try to ban Bitcoin stating \"<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\">Terrorists Use Bitcoin</a>\". The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. Some nations are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country\">banning Bitcoin</a>. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is nearly doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue or accelerate.\n\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\n\nBitcoin will continue to maintain its\' price over the long run. It is unique and valuable. It can\'t die because the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35\">Bitcoin network</a> is too powerful. I don\'t see that Bitcoin will be replaced since it is a protocol that can be updated upon agreement of the community. If some feature is desired and the community agrees that it is good, then it should be incorporated into the protocol. This is similar to the HTTP and WWW protocol. The network won\'t be replaced by a superior technology since it can be updated. For the short term, Bitcoin will be volatile - that is, the price will fluctuate up and down. You may purchase bitcoins and find out that it lost 30% of its price in a week. However, the average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since it was first launched in 2009.\n\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\n\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting to buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time they will buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market. However, this volatility should go away as more people are in the market. More people will buy bitcoins when the price goes down and sell bitcoins when the price goes up. This will stop spikes and crashes. The more people that are in Bitcoin, the more pressure there will be on the price. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is low and buy thus bringing the price up. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is high and sell thus bring the price down. Over time, the price will continue to increase just as it has been doing since 2009.\n\n<b>Price</b>\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. These trades will set the current price. The latest trade price will be the advertised current price of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand.\n\nSome people think that a single bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the price will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are currently hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s and growing every month. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\n\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\n\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of a bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $200 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$400. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin and it won\'t stay above what it costs to mine for any significant period of time.\n\nI would approximate that it costs about $150 to mine a bitcoin in an industrial setting. It costs $200+ to mine one from home. Whatever the price to mine a bitcoin, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. Overtime, the rewards to mine get cut in half, so it becomes more expensive to mine. Once that happens, the price should rise. Also, if demand is greater than the number of bitcoins mined, then the price will rise. If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\n\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoins will be redirected to purchasing bitcoins directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that the price of a bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\n\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\n<ol>\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\n\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into Bitcoin very early.\n\n<b>Liquidity</b>\n\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoins immediately after receiving them - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how Bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-31 05:41:44','2015-01-31 05:41:44','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=139',0,'revision','',0),(140,1,'2015-01-30 04:28:07','2015-01-30 04:28:07','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs\" width=\"522\" height=\"382\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-137\" /></a>\n\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\n\nUsers will need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some a fair market rate. They price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. Again, the price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoin - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoin ever and there is currently about 14,000,000. Most bitcoin has already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoin per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoin per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoin - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with bitcoin. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be ingenious inventions that will allow Bitcoin or some similar currency be used just as the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers”. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nIt is currently a monopoly. People have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current VISA/MasterCard/American Express/Discover/Western Union illegal? The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is near doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nEven if Bitcoin is replaced with a superior digital currency, it will continue to maintain some value. Whether it will be a collector’s item in the future or adopted as the mainstream digital currency is a thought to ponder. I’m certain that a competitor to the current financial system will come into existence.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market.\r\n\r\n<b>Value</b>\r\n\r\nThe value of the bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. This will set the price. The latest trade price will be the current value of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand. Some people think that bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the value will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $250 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$600. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin. I would approximate it that it costs at least $200 a bitcoin to mine. That might not be accurate, but whatever the price is, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. If the price does fall below, the money used to mine bitcoin will be redirected to purchasing bitcoin directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that bitcoin does not fall below the $200 threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important from now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoin for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoin for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoin</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want much less.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoin relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and 1 bitcoin will be a milestone for someone to own. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket. There does not yet exist 14 million bitcoin and it will not happen for at least a few months into 2015. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. 90% of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and people that got into bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoin immediately after receiving it. If this is how bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and other reasons. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this as an important factor.\r\n\r\n<b>Balancing Account</b>\r\n\r\nSome variation of a spending &amp; saving account could conceptually be created. They would contain an equal amount of bitcoin and dollar when adding funds to it could be used to maximize saving and spending. If the price of bitcoin has fallen since making a deposit, then spend cash on the current purchase. If the price of bitcoin has risen since making a deposit, then spend bitcoin on the current purchase.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Arbitrage</b>\r\n\r\nArbitrage is when investors buy a bitcoin from one exchange at a lower price and sell it at another price for a higher price. This balances the price between the exchanges. It can be profitable for the investors engaged in this activity. It is a risk, though. If the price is crashing before they make the buy and sell.\r\n\r\n<b>Trading Stocks</b>\r\n\r\nThe value of a stock counts on the value of the service that the business provides. Bitcoin has a valuable service. The value of this service will be reflected in the value of a single bitcoin and in the value of the businesses surrounding bitcoin. As long as the 51% of the servers is not taken over by a malicious attacker, then bitcoin should retain some value. Even if the 51% attack was to happen, there would be a fork that the rest of the community would start moving forward with.\r\n\r\n<b>Volatility Insurance</b>\r\n\r\nCompanies are afraid to hold onto bitcoin that they receive because it could go down by 20% in the next few days. That would make them lose money on a sale. An insurance to cover volatility could be created. It could be commission based on the fluctuations. The insurance company would collect a percentage of the increase in value in an exchange to cover the dips in value. This would take the risk out of a crash for some companies that may hold bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Insured Bitcoin Accounts</b>\r\n\r\nThere are currently insured accounts available at some exchanges. I’m sure more will grow. They are responsible for any bitcoin that was lost or stolen because of them. This includes hackers attacking their systems. It does not include someone getting ahold of your username and password. Also, they usually have 2 factor authentication so they would need your password and either your email or cellphone authentication. Authentication would be done by sending an e-mail with a confirmation link or sending a text message with a confirmation code that needs to be entered into the site before a transaction can take place. Fund that are stolen from a traditional debit card are usually not insured. However, funds stolen off of a credit card are usually covered by the credit card company. Those funds come from the consumers through fees and high interest rates. The problem with insurance is relatively easy to address for Bitcoin. Corporations will provide this service. They will need to make a profit for that service, so bitcoin holders that choose these services will probably pay for them. Some companies make their profits through other ways that will offload the costs to the customer.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-revision-v1','','','2015-01-30 04:38:19','2015-01-30 04:38:19','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=146',0,'revision','',0),(147,1,'2015-01-30 22:51:54','2015-01-30 22:51:54','<b>Balancing Account</b>\r\n\r\nA balancing account is an idea that I have.

Some variation of a spending &amp; saving account could conceptually be created. They would contain an equal amount of bitcoins and USD when adding funds to it. This could be used to maximize savings and minimize spending. If the price of bitcoin has fallen since making a deposit, then spend cash on the current purchase. If the price of bitcoin has risen since making a deposit, then spend bitcoin on the current purchase. This will ensure that the user always made money of their deposits before spending.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Arbitrage</b>\r\n\r\nArbitrage is when investors buy a bitcoin from one exchange at a lower price and sell it at another price for a higher price. This balances the price between the exchanges. It can be profitable for the investors engaged in this activity. It is a risk, though. If the price is crashing before they make the buy and sell, then they will lose money.\r\n\r\n<b>Trading Stocks</b>\r\n\r\nThe price of a stock depends on the value of the service that the business provides. Bitcoin is an extremely valuable service. The value of this service will be reflected in the price of a single bitcoin and in the value of the businesses surrounding bitcoin. As long as the 51% of the servers is not taken over by a malicious attacker, then bitcoin should retain some value. Even if the 51% attack was to happen, there would be a fork that the rest of the community would start moving forward with. The network is not theoretically impenetrable but in practice, it is impenetrable.\r\n\r\n<b>Volatility Insurance</b>\r\n\r\nCompanies are afraid to hold onto bitcoin that they receive because it could go down by 20% in the next few days. That would make them lose money on a sale. An insurance to cover volatility could be created. It could be commission based on the fluctuations. The insurance company would collect a percentage of the increase in value in an exchange to cover the dips in value. This would take the risk out of a crash for some companies that may hold bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Insured Bitcoin Accounts</b>\r\n\r\nThere are currently insured accounts available at some exchanges. I’m sure more will grow. They are responsible for any bitcoin that was lost or stolen because of them. This includes hackers attacking their systems. It does not include someone getting ahold of your username and password.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some at fair market rate. The price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. The price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoin - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoins ever and there is currently about 14,000,000 as of early 2015. Most bitcoins have already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoin per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoin per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoin - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with bitcoin since bitcoins are fluid. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even in virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency that can be used for real tangible products. A two-way virtual currency is one that can be converted from USD and back. Most virtual currencies are one way - you can trade USD for the virtual currency but you can\'t trade the virtual currency for USD. Bitcoin is different since it has so many uses.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have not yet been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be innovative products that will allow Bitcoin to be used more conveniently than the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount of wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers” or just lucky. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering. Some individuals that have large amounts of bitcoins could become billionaires if Bitcoin goes main stream. You can view the <a href=\"http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100\">BitcoinRichList</a>. The numbers are actually worse than what is displayed at that website. Most large holders of bitcoins have their bitcoins spread out among many different addresses. There are a small number of people that own a large percentage of the bitcoins. This is also true for most currencies and stocks.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nPeople have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current payment methods illegal? They could try to ban Bitcoin stating \"<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\">Terrorists Use Bitcoin</a>\". The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. Some nations are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country\">banning Bitcoin</a>. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is nearly doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue or accelerate.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin will continue to maintain its\' price over the long run. It is unique and valuable. It can\'t die because the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35\">Bitcoin network</a> is too powerful. I don\'t see that Bitcoin will be replaced since it is a protocol that can be updated upon agreement of the community. If some feature is desired and the community agrees that it is good, then it should be incorporated into the protocol. This is similar to the HTTP and WWW protocol. The network won\'t be replaced by a superior technology since it can be updated. For the short term, Bitcoin will be volatile - that is, the price will fluctuate up and down. You may purchase bitcoins and find out that it lost 30% of its price in a week. However, the average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since it was first launched in 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting to buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time they will buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market. However, this volatility should go away as more people are in the market. More people will buy bitcoins when the price goes down and sell bitcoins when the price goes up. This will stop spikes and crashes. The more people that are in Bitcoin, the more pressure there will be on the price. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is low and buy thus bringing the price up. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is high and sell thus bring the price down. Over time, the price will continue to increase just as it has been doing since 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Price</b>\r\n\r\nThe price of the bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. These trades will set the current price. The latest trade price will be the advertised current price of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand.\r\n\r\nSome people think that bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the price will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are currently hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s and growing every month. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $200 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$400. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin and it won\'t stay above what it costs to mine for any significant period of time.\r\n\r\nI would approximate that it costs about $150 to mine a bitcoin in an industrial setting. It costs $200+ to mine one from home. Whatever the price to mine a bitcoin, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. Overtime, the rewards to mine get cut in half, so it becomes more expensive to mine. Once that happens, the price should rise. Also, if demand is greater than the number of bitcoins mined, then the price will rise. If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\r\n\r\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoin will be redirected to purchasing bitcoin directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoin immediately after receiving it - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-revision-v1','','','2015-01-30 22:52:08','2015-01-30 22:52:08','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=149',0,'revision','',0),(150,1,'2015-01-31 05:42:05','2015-01-31 05:42:05','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8642373-digital-illustration-of-house-on-money-stack-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-145\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8642373-digital-illustration-of-house-on-money-stack-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Digital illustration of house on money stack\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Hoarders</b>\r\n\r\nHoarding will have to be balanced.

The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin network and their supporters will back the integrity of the system.\n\nGovernments will back the integrity of the system because they are obligated to protect their citizens\' interests. However, there will be controversy when governments attempt to freeze wallet addresses on the blockchain that contain illegally obtained bitcoin. The protocol does not currently support these freezes, but could governments force such a change? Read about the proposed Hot List further\n\n<b>Network of Trust</b>\n\nIf all the parties can come to a fair agreement of how much hashing power is needed, then there wouldn\'t need to be a race to the bottom by wasting efforts on mining. It is naturally competitive as to reward the parties with the most hashing power. This agreement will not come as a verbal agreement between the parties but it will be agreed upon naturally through the price of a bitcoin.\n\nLike in real life, no one party will want to take over more than 51% of the network because the value of the system would dwindle and their profits would dwindle. There will always be several large competitors that will prevent any one entity from controlling 51% of the network.\n\nSomeone that has control of 51% of the network will want to keep the integrity of the transactions - they would not benefit from altering any information in the network. The system will maintain a natural balance between people around the world - they will want to be friendly with each other. A majority of people are good and the network is an image of the miners and users of Bitcoin. It is a natural trust based system with laws to hold integrity.\n\nThe price of a bitcoin will be worth what people will make it worth. People will naturally make the Bitcoin network worth the services that it provides. If it does provide all the services of banking and credit cards and a whole lot more, then it will be extremely valuable. All parties that are involved with Bitcoin will want it to continue to succeed. An attack from outside the bitcoin network would be the most likely since Bitcoin competitors would benefit from the system failing. However, it would be cheaper for an outside party to buy into the network and try to control it from within. Terrorists will not ever acquire enough power to take down 51% of the network. Governments may have the power to do this. But, the governments that have that much power would be able to acquire control of much of bitcoin through mining and purchasing bitcoin. Also, governments are obligated to protect their citizens\' assets.\n\n<b>Bitcoin vs Manual Audits</b>\n\nA transaction and store of value system like the current financial institutions use manual audits to ensure the integrity of their network. Any business can be audited to make sure all transactions are accurate and complete. If they are not, they will suffer legal consequences. Is the current setup of audits more efficient than Bitcoin mining? I would say no since the credit card and bank fees are so high. A competitor, like Bitcoin, will ensure that the financial institutions are working as efficiently as possible because if they don\'t, then their customers may leave. The financial institutions will have to be able to compete with the services that Bitcoin is offering and they have to do it with either more quality, better security, or for cheaper. Options are always a good thing for consumers. It will force the financial sector to compete for customers. They may use many methods to compete.\n\n<b>Attention in Media</b>\n\nIt can be profitable for news agencies to report on the fallacies of Bitcoin. These reports, in turn, make Bitcoin less valuable. It is a downward spiral. However, people communicate with each other. There are lots of more people using Bitcoin and their are <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">statistics</a> to prove it. They will teach their friends of its’ advantages. Their friends will teach their friends and that cycle will continue until the general public is educated about the facts of Bitcoin.\n\n<b>Community Agrees To Update</b>\n\nIf a general consensus among the Bitcoin miners agree to change the protocol, then this could have significant implications for the digital currency. This happens a lot for minor updates and is discussed in the Bitcoin community for major changes. A hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin miners might want to change the having of Bitcoin rewards to every 8 years instead of every 4 years is possible, but it is unlikely that a majority of people would agree to that. It would be profitable for the miners to do such a thing. But, this would cause belief in the system to dwindle and hurt them more than reward them.\n\nPeople value bitcoin as a store of wealth and unethical changes to the protocol would cause the price to plummet. Many miners are deeply vested into Bitcoin and they do not want this to happen because it would not be beneficial to them. If something like this did happen, there would probably be a fork and the existing version would run in parallel to the new version. That would be terrible for the system for everyone involved. People would have to decide which fork to choose between. Current holders would want the old version and people that want to get on board might want the new version. I think that the community would see all the struggles that taking such an action would cause and they would not want to damage the market that they exist in. These scenarios are hypothetical and not practical.\n\n<b>Fork</b>\n\nA fork in Bitcoin is when there are two separate versions that have been worked on and they share a previous point where they were the same - they share a common ancestor. For example, github hosts software projects for developers and when someone has a public project up there, someone else could fork a copy of the current version and start working on it in parallel. The original developer would also be working on the original version. They could both save their copies and they would be different and not share the changes that were made by both of the parties. Some people suggest that a fork in the bitcoin could be used. It would take a majority of the miners to approve a different version that will be accepted by the community. In practice, there would be an overwhelming majority that agrees to any updates because it would not be beneficial to anyone otherwise. It would be a guaranteed loss for everyone!\n\nIn the event that a successful 51% attack on the system happens, there would be a fork with the 49% that maintains the integrity. Users would have to ensure they are using the \"good\" fork. This attack is theoretically possible but in practice, it is impossible.\n\n<b>Hot List</b>\n\nHypothetically, there could be a hot list added to Bitcoin. If enough miners agreed to update the core code, then a hot list of addresses holding stolen bitcoins could be frozen. They would then be able to use them for legitimate uses. This would render those bitcoins nearly useless and it would make it not so profitable for bad people to steal bitcoins from people. This would be hard to maintain and it should be hard for a person to place addresses in a hot list but it would be beneficial for the entire system and help it be accepted in the mainstream. The original holder of the bitcoins would have to prove that the bitcoins do indeed belong to them. Once it is on the host list, it would be worth little to nothing. This might even influence some hackers to give the bitcoin back for an agreed small percentage of legal bitcoin. This hot list would probably only be feasible for large thefts.\n\n<b>Charitable Donations</b>\n\nWhen you donate money to a 3rd world country, not all of that money reaches there. If you wanted to donate $1, probably about $0.10 will reach the hungry child that you wanted to feed and the other $0.90 ends up going to the 3rd parties in between. With Bitcoin, it will be possible to donate $1 to starving children and $1 will reach its targeted donation. The implications of what Bitcoin could do for the world are huge. It is <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">arguably free</a> to use! There will be 3rd party applications that will absorb any costs to send money. The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\n\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\n\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes. This is currently the case, but it is easy to convert bitcoins to USD and possibly in the future, the IRS might reconsider. NYC is proposing allowing people to <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/31/new-york-parking-ticket-app/\">pay parking tickets with bitcoins</a>. This would save the people and the city a lot of money in financial fees with credit cards and the costs associated with mailing checks. Bitcoin would be useful for collecting tolls on highways for the same reasons. People could get a sticker on their car and have the payment automatically go through. This would save the highway management and people money by cutting out the banks from the middle of the transaction.\n\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin Theories & Concepts','','inherit','open','open','','42-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-31 06:32:26','2015-01-31 06:32:26','',42,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=152',0,'revision','',0),(153,1,'2015-01-31 06:22:38','2015-01-31 06:22:38','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-151\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\" alt=\"nuclear bomb explosion\" width=\"447\" height=\"447\" /></a></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\n\r\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two nations won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have the potential to destroy the other.

It is easy to write a computer program to accept an incoming transfer and then break it up and send a piece of it to several different addresses. The bitcoins that get sent around won\'t have the fees attached to them like what happens in the market now. It is programmable because it is easy to write a program that automatically distributes funds based on actions the users take while using a computer application.\n\nVisualize this scenario:\n<blockquote>A third party wants to accept donations and divide it between several charities. This would be too expensive to do with credit cards and bank transfers. This can\'t be completed or verified immediately either. Now someone will be able to donate $0.25 to their favorite 50 charities that they choose with a click of a button. Each of those charities will be able to receive a half penny. This will only count as one transaction on the blockchain since there can be multiple receiving addresses in a single transaction. It is immediately verified that the charitable addresses received the donation. This can all be done programmatically.</blockquote>\nThat is just one demonstration of how it is programmable. There are many other justifications as to why Bitcoin is more programmable than the USD. The USD takes days for transactions to clear and Credit Cards can take up to months before the transaction is cleared and the funds are available to the parties. Most banks and financial institutions have barriers to allowing money to be so easily distributed and utilized via a computer program.\n\nIt is difficult for the international community of businesses and individuals to cooperate financially with the current financial instruments available to them. With Bitcoin, essentially any individual or group of individuals can create and maintain their own bank. They can write the programs to do whatever they can imagine with their bitcoins. The program can send and receive funds with the only limit being its\' creators imagination. That is difficult to do with cash. When you send old-fashioned money, you are really just sending a note for your bank to transfer the funds to them. There is a physical presence of that money that needs to be maintained. There is no guarantee of payment with USD until you get the money physically.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two AntMiner S5s because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will be printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 5 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and the adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-02-01 10:32:56','2015-02-01 10:32:56','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=165',0,'revision','',0),(166,1,'2015-02-01 13:29:12','2015-02-01 13:29:12','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52\" style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"introducingbitcoinusd\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\nBitcoin is a tool to move wealth from old financial institutions to a younger more tech savvy crowd.

I don\'t think people should not buy or use automobiles because they might get stolen. People could only use trains and buses so they don\'t have to worry about their car being stolen, but a car can be much more convenient than a bus or train. Similarly, bitcoins can be much more convenient than cash or credit cards, however, it is more risky just like having an automobile is more risky than a train or bus. Credit cards and cash are much more limiting than Bitcoin and they are also more expensive. Buses and trains are typically cheaper than cars, but are very limiting.\r\n\r\nFor Mt. Gox, it was concluded that it was an inside job by the owners of the company. They stole nearly $500,000,000 worth of bitcoins at the time. The price was artificially inflated by bots during that period so the actual value was probably closer to $100,000,000 worth of bitcoins. We are in the early stages like in the wild west with gold - there will be some high profile hacks and lots of little hacks.

This revolutionary technology allows a college student living off student loans the ability to build useful financial applications that can be used by the masses. Before Bitcoin, only the elitist wealthy owners of financial institutions had this ability. Now, anybody can create a revolutionary app to manage financial affairs.\r\n\r\nThis is the WWW all over again; it is the beginning of a new era like the revolution that happened with smart phones. This one is bigger than the smart phones because Bitcoin has some fierce and powerful competitors unlike the smart phone. There was no competition for smartphones - well, land lines? Cellphones evolved into smartphones so they are \"one and the same\" instead of being a competitor. The WWW had no competitor; the old in store commerce did not even see the threat of e-commerce until it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe people that Bitcoiners will be taking business from are the most wealthy and powerful people. It is the top 1%. It is the top .1% and even higher. They have control of media and they influence what the general population sees and thinks. There is going to be a battle for this new business opportunity. The huge transaction fees that banks are bringing in are up for grabs. If Bitcoin offers superior services for less costs, then people should naturally move into Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nWhoever creates the new \"killer apps\" may become wealthy in a short period of time. It won\'t take much for technologists to enter or at least come close to the ranks of the 1% in this crucial point in history. The killer apps that will be taking the electronic financial market by storm are in development and some have already been launched, but there is plenty of room for more!\r\n\r\nBesides the financial market, the blockchain has uses outside finance. It works as a proof of existence: store a hash of a file on the blockchain to prove that the file existed at a certain time in history. The document will be notarized and this can be done <a title=\"Bitcoin is Programmable Money\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45\">programatically</a> - someone that wants to put 1,000,000 proofs of existence on the blockchain can easily write a program to accomplish that task. This public ledger of information is immutable, that is, it can not be changed once it is verified and written to a block. This transaction will be a part of history - it will exist for all time!','Bitcoin is Revolutionary','','inherit','open','open','','84-revision-v1','','','2015-02-01 13:29:13','2015-02-01 13:29:13','',84,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=172',0,'revision','',0),(173,1,'2015-02-02 00:22:27','2015-02-02 00:22:27','<a href=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe use of physical money will be replaced by digital currencies. You might ask: \"What are we going to do with all of the old paper currencies?\" Well, we could certainly start building financial museums and someday bring our grandchildren there telling them: \"this is what we used to use when we were young\". Will it be just Bitcoin in the future? Absolutely not! The USD is almost a digital money already. Most transactions are done with credit cards or bank wires, but Bitcoin will have its role to play in the world. The USD is mostly just digits on a screen, anyhow - they are very similar, but Bitcoin has a lot of useful features that the USD does not have. It is possible that the USD will convert to a model that is more similar to Bitcoin, but that would be difficult to accomplish considering the foundations of our financial infrastructure was built on the current properties of the USD. If the USD acquires all the features that Bitcoins has, which it won\'t, will Bitcoin still have a role to play? Yes, I would say - Bitcoin is an extremely powerful <a title=\"Electronic Financial Instruments\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126\">financial instrument</a> that is <a title=\"Bitcoin is Programmable Money\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45\">easily programmable</a>!\n\nThe current owners of the physical money are not going to need to trade in their old bills. It would be wise for people to diversify their assets in case if the price of a bitcoin rises significantly compared to the USD.\n\nWill Bitcoin be one of the worlds\' currencies? It absolutely will be - it already has! The real question is: \"how large of a fraction of the pie of currencies will Bitcoin become?\"  Currently, most transactions with the USD and other fiat currencies are already digital. There is not actual physical cash that exists for all of the money that is out there. When someone gets a loan from the bank, they are lending out money that is in their accounts that belong to other people. So, do the people that have the money in their bank accounts also have that money, too? Does the account holder have $100,000 in the bank even though the bank lent that $100,000 to a home owner? That is $200,000 worth of money but only $100,000 in cash actually exists. Banks are required to hold 15% of the \"money\" as physical \"cash\". The rest is insured by the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/\">FDIC</a> (up to a certain amount) if account holders need their cash but the bank does not have it. There is no FDIC insurance for a Bitcoin wallet, but there are exchanges that offer private insurance on their accounts such as <a href=\"http://www.circle.com/\">Circle</a> and <a href=\"http://xapo.com/\">Xapo</a>.\n\nBank account holders are in fact lending their money to people that are holding debt to the bank. The account holders sometimes get some small amount of interest for the money in their bank accounts - it is not significant; it won\'t keep up with inflation. On top of the potential interest, the banks provide services in exchange for the bank holders\' cash. What would happen if a large number of people went to their banks and took out all of their money? The banks would not have enough. The FDIC insures the accounts so they have to send the money to the banks so they can give them to the account holders. If this happened rapidly, the FDIC would have to get the treasury to print a lot of money to payback the account holders. The people with debt to the bank would owe the bank and the FDIC the money on their loan. The home owner might or might not have a lot of wealth if they have a mortgage on their home. Homes would go way up in USD value since there is more money in circulation - most of them will have fixed rate interest.  The homeowners would benefit because there home would be worth more than what they owe on it but people holding actual money would be hurt because of the inflation.\n\nHow much would a large influx of investors buying bitcoins affect the financial system? The people that previously had the bitcoins and sold them to the people that took the money out of their banks to buy bitcoins will have a large portion of USD and possibly they will keep a significant portion of these bitcoins. This will potentially displace some of the funds from the banks and their other investments. Most of the USD will end up back in the banks which will, in turn, lend them out and the cycle will continue. Even if Bitcoin went mainstream, it will not cause a financial crisis; it will only open up more opportunity and cause the existing financial infrastructure to be more efficient and competitive. It may cause some obsolete services to go away.\n\nWhat happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. This will cause the Bitcoin to rise against the USD and it will transfer wealth to Bitcoin holders. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to mostly maintain the current distribution of wealth. Bitcoin has a long way to go to become relevant, but it is <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">growing rapidly</a>. There will be quite a few new millionaires and billionaires if Bitcoin goes mainstream. Bitcoin technology just might be the world\'s next largest international financial system that is widely recognized. Gold is an example of an international transaction system, but it is for the museums &amp; collectors now; it is impractical to use it for transactions.\n\n\"Receipts of gold\" was the next international transaction system - these receipts were called dollars, but then the dollars got detached from Gold. They then started making receipts for the dollar and transacted the receipts instead of transacting physical dollars - those were checks. They then created the Internet and could send digital receipts of the physical dollars - those were wire transfers and credit/debit cards. The current system is a mixture of  dollars, receipts of dollars and digital receipts of dollars. It is easy to exchange the digital receipts of dollars. Bitcoin is superior to digital receipts of dollars since it is self-contained. There has to be a lot of trust built between the parties when utilizing the current financial model since digital receipts of dollars are worthless unless if they are honored. With Bitcoin, this trust is not needed; once the transaction is complete, the wealth transfer has been honored and it can\'t be reversed. The Bitcoin system enforces integrity: money can only be sent from a wallet if a private key is provided. There is no need for an inefficient central authority to guarantee the integrity of transactions; Bitcoin transactions can be made with absolute certainty.','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','inherit','open','open','','64-autosave-v1','','','2015-02-02 00:22:27','2015-02-02 00:22:27','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=173',0,'revision','',0),(174,1,'2015-02-01 22:44:58','2015-02-01 22:44:58','<a href=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe use of physical money will be replaced by digital currencies.

There is no need for an inefficient central authority to guarantee the integrity of transactions; Bitcoin transactions can be made almost instantly with absolute certainty.','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','inherit','open','open','','64-revision-v1','','','2015-02-02 00:22:46','2015-02-02 00:22:46','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=175',0,'revision','',0),(176,1,'2015-02-02 01:44:34','2015-02-02 01:44:34','Charts coming soon!','Bitcoin Charts','','trash','open','open','','bitcoin-charts','','','2015-02-02 01:46:00','2015-02-02 01:46:00','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?page_id=176',0,'page','',0),(177,1,'2015-02-02 01:44:34','2015-02-02 01:44:34','Charts coming soon!','Bitcoin Charts','','inherit','open','open','','176-revision-v1','','','2015-02-02 01:44:34','2015-02-02 01:44:34','',176,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=177',0,'revision','',0),(178,1,'2015-02-02 01:46:45','2015-02-02 01:46:45','','Auto Draft','','trash','open','open','','auto-draft','','','2015-02-02 01:46:53','2015-02-02 01:46:53','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?page_id=178',0,'page','',0),(179,1,'2015-02-02 01:46:53','2015-02-02 01:46:53','','Auto Draft','','inherit','open','open','','178-revision-v1','','','2015-02-02 01:46:53','2015-02-02 01:46:53','',178,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=179',0,'revision','',0),(180,1,'2015-02-02 01:47:06','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Auto Draft','','auto-draft','open','open','','','','','2015-02-02 01:47:06','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?page_id=180',0,'page','',0),(181,1,'2015-02-02 01:49:43','2015-02-02 01:49:43','','Auto Draft','','trash','open','open','','auto-draft-2','','','2015-02-02 01:49:50','2015-02-02 01:49:50','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?page_id=181',0,'page','',0),(182,1,'2015-02-02 01:49:50','2015-02-02 01:49:50','','Auto Draft','','inherit','open','open','','181-revision-v1','','','2015-02-02 01:49:50','2015-02-02 01:49:50','',181,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=182',0,'revision','',0),(183,1,'2015-02-02 01:50:29','2015-02-02 01:50:29','','','','trash','open','open','','183','','','2015-02-02 01:50:34','2015-02-02 01:50:34','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?page_id=183',0,'page','',0),(184,1,'2015-02-02 01:50:29','2015-02-02 01:50:29','','','','inherit','open','open','','183-revision-v1','','','2015-02-02 01:50:29','2015-02-02 01:50:29','',183,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=184',0,'revision','',0),(185,1,'2015-02-02 01:52:16','2015-02-02 01:52:16','<script src=\"wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/js/highcharts/js/highcharts.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/js/highcharts/js/modules/exporting.js\"></script>\r\n<label for=\"spinner\">Days Average:</label>\r\n<input id=\"spinnerValue\" name=\"value\" value=\"1\">\r\n<button id=\"update\">Update</button>\r\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"min-width: 275px;
