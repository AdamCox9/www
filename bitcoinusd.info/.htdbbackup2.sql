This was reported by <a href=\"http://klikki.fi/\">Jouko Pynnonen</a>. This issue does not affect version 4.0, but version 4.0.1 does address these eight security issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three cross-site scripting issues that a contributor or author could use to compromise a site. Discovered by <a href=\"http://joncave.co.uk/\">Jon Cave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.miqrogroove.com/\">Robert Chapin</a>, and <a href=\"https://johnblackbourn.com/\">John Blackbourn</a> of the WordPress security team.</li>\n<li>A cross-site request forgery that could be used to trick a user into changing their password.</li>\n<li>An issue that could lead to a denial of service when passwords are checked. Reported by <a href=\"http://www.behindthefirewalls.com/\">Javier Nieto Arevalo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.devconsole.info/\">Andres Rojas Guerrero</a>.</li>\n<li>Additional protections for server-side request forgery attacks when WordPress makes HTTP requests. Reported by Ben Bidner (vortfu).</li>\n<li>An extremely unlikely hash collision could allow a user&#8217;s account to be compromised, that also required that they haven&#8217;t logged in since 2008 (I wish I were kidding). Reported by <a href=\"http://david.dw-perspective.org.uk\">David Anderson</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress now invalidates the links in a password reset email if the user remembers their password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported separately by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MomenBassel\">Momen Bassel</a>, <a href=\"http://c0dehouse.blogspot.in/\">Tanoy Bose</a>, and <a href=\"https://managewp.com/\">Bojan Slavković of ManageWP</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 4.0.1 also fixes 23 bugs with 4.0, and we&#8217;ve made two hardening changes, including better validation of EXIF data we are extracting from uploaded photos.

As of August 2014, PHP 5.3 no longer receives patches for security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-version-stats-updated-more-than-13-of-sites-are-running-wordpress-4-1\" target=\"_blank\">Recent updates to WordPress.org stats</a> indicate that 16.4% of WordPress sites are still running on PHP 5.2 and 38% on PHP 5.3. According to lead developer Andrew Nacin, bumping the minimum required version is not likely to happen soon, due to the sheer number of sites that would be negatively impacted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One-sixth of all sites running PHP 5.2 is still many millions of sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we move the PHP minimum version too early, we risk stranding millions of installs on older versions of WordPress.&#8221; In the meantime, the WordPress project is researching the current state of PHP offerings available at popular hosts and will soon be urging them to update to more recent versions.</p>\n<p>WordPress developer <a href=\"http://coenjacobs.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Coen Jacobs</a> believes that the effort to contact hosts will not be enough to help everyone. His new <a href=\"http://www.wpupdatephp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPupdatePHP</a> project was created to educate end users on outdated versions of PHP. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WPupdatePHP/wp-update-php\" target=\"_blank\">WPupdatePHP library</a> is a tool that developers can bundle into their plugins in order to require users to upgrade to PHP 5.4+ hosting. It is intended for use within new plugins, not for locking users out of existing ones.</p>\n<p>If a users does not meet the minimum PHP version requirements when installing the plugin, he will be presented with an admin notice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this plugin can not run on PHP versions older than [ specified version ]. Read more information about <a href=\"http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/\">how you can update</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea of the WPupdatePHP project is to enlist end users in putting pressure on hosts to <a href=\"http://www.wpupdatephp.com/update/\" target=\"_blank\">update their versions of PHP</a>. A future version of the library would add the ability for developers to make the PHP version a “soft requirement,” which would still display the notice but won’t stop the user from using the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core WordPress team can’t get every single hosting company to comply,&#8221; Jacobs said in a recent post titled <em><a href=\"http://coenjacobs.me/updating-php-everyones-responsibility/\" target=\"_blank\">Updating PHP is Everyone’s Responsibility</a></em>. &#8220;I admire their intentions, but in reality this is not going to help everybody.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He predicts a need for the WPupdatePHP library even after WordPress bumps its minimum required PHP version. &#8220;PHP 5.4 is actually already nearing its EOL date and we’re still figuring out how to make PHP 5.2 and 5.3 platforms go away,&#8221; he said. In mid-September 2015, PHP 5.4 will not longer receive security fixes.</p>\n<p>Jacobs believes that the changes that need to happen require more than a one-time campaign where the WordPress project successfully badgers hosts to update to PHP 5.4.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In six months we’ll have this same issue all over again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As soon as webhosting companies have finally finished off their PHP 5.2 and 5.3 environments, we can start this whole campaign all over again to get rid of PHP 5.4. And so on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you are a WordPress developer interested in enlisting your plugin&#8217;s users to help push hosts to update PHP versions, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/WPupdatePHP/wp-update-php\" target=\"_blank\">WPupdatePHP on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The end user is one of our most important, but underestimated, assets in this battle,&#8221; Jacobs said. &#8220;They have the strongest voice in this all.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 09 Mar 2015 22:24:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Adds oEmbed Support For CartoDB Maps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=40265\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-adds-oembed-support-for-cartodb-maps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1371:\"<p>WordPress.com <a title=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/cartodb-embeds/\" href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/cartodb-embeds/\">now supports oEmbeds</a> for<a title=\"http://cartodb.com/\" href=\"http://cartodb.com/\"> CartoDB,</a> a tool used to create and share interactive maps.

Lovecraft</a>, an American horror fiction author known for his &#8220;weird realism&#8221; &#8211; the idea that reality is fundamentally weird and the human mind is incapable of realistically representing it.</p>\n<p>Norén&#8217;s tribute to Lovecraft&#8217;s work is conveyed most clearly through the serif-heavy typography of the theme and a strong focus on the imagery assigned to each post. He selected Google Font&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display\" target=\"_blank\">Playfair Display</a> for page and post headers, accompanied by Georgia for the body text. The bright red links and red post meta complement the design&#8217;s literary theme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40251]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"lovecraft\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40267\" /></a></p>\n<p>The homepage showcases a full-width header image and each post replaces that image with its own featured image. These images, along with the rest of the theme, gracefully scale down for smaller devices.</p>\n<p>Lovecraft, like many other recently released themes, adds additional features by offering support for <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack</a>, including the infinite scroll module and styles for tiled galleries.</p>\n<p>Norén took every small detail into consideration when creating Lovecraft, as you can see with the blockquotes design, ordered lists, post media, and form styles on the <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/lovecraft/style-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">Style Guide</a> page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft-blockquote.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40251]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lovecraft-blockquote.jpg?resize=617%2C217\" alt=\"lovecraft-blockquote\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40283\" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme allows you to select the accent color via the customizer. It also includes support for a custom logo, editor styles, and matching widgets for Flicker, recent posts, and recent comments with thumbnails. Pages have an additional template for full-width display. Check out the <a href=\"http://andersnoren.se/themes/lovecraft/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see Lovecraft in action.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a bold new theme for your blog and you appreciate strong serif fonts, Lovecraft is a thoughtfully-designed option.

According to court documents, United States Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero <a title=\"http://ia601008.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cand.272130/gov.uscourts.cand.272130.31.0.pdf\" href=\"http://ia601008.us.archive.org/20/items/gov.uscourts.cand.272130/gov.uscourts.cand.272130.31.0.pdf\">wrote a report</a> and recommendation in favor of Automattic and Hotham. The <a title=\"http://torrentfreak.com/images/wp-steiner.pdf\" href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/images/wp-steiner.pdf\">courts agreed with his report</a> and recommendation. Since the defendant chose to default, the courts saw no reason to require further expenditure of resources and awarded the victory to Automattic.</p>\n<p>The settlement is split between three parties: Automattic&#8217;s employee time, attorneys, and Hotham.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is Ordered and Adjudged that defendant Nick Steiner pay damages in the amount of $960.00 for Hotham’s work and time, $1,860.00 for time spent by Automattic’s employees, and $22,264.00 for Automattic’s attorney’s fees, for a total award of $25,084.00.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two things I take away from the victory. First, it sets a precedent that Automattic can and will fight against those who abuse the <a title=\"http://automattic.com/dmca-notice/\" href=\"http://automattic.com/dmca-notice/\">DMCA takedown procedure</a>.

The company also <a href=\"https://github.com/openname\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced the protocol and directory software</a> so that developers can build their own infrastructure with it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe the future of identity will be decentralized, and for any identity system to be truly decentralized, no entity can have a monopoly over registering users or displaying their profiles. Anyone should be able to claim a username and fill out their profiles either using a provider/registrar of their choice or on their own without any third party.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://openname.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Openname</a> decentralized identity and naming system is built on the Blockchain. It makes it possible for anyone to create an online identity, which can then be used to make Bitcoin transactions. The company&#8217;s long-term goal is to pioneer a decentralized authentication protocol:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What we need is a password-less authentication process that doesn&#8217;t require any particular third party; an open, decentralized auth protocol that lets users conveniently sign in and be in control of the data they release to apps and where they store it.</p>\n<p>Openname Auth is our work-in-progress proposal for decentralized, password-less authentication in which users login by simply entering a username (their openname) and approving an auth request on their desktop or mobile device.</p></blockquote>\n<p>OneName <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/14/y-combinator-backed-onename-raises-1-5m-open-sources-its-bitcoin-identity-directory/\" target=\"_blank\">raised $1.5 million in funding</a> to continue developing the platform as part of its quest to <a href=\"http://blog.onename.io/evolution-of-the-internet/\" target=\"_blank\">return the web to its decentralized roots</a>.</p>\n<h3>Openname Avatars for WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress core supports <a href=\"https://en.gravatar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravatar</a> by default for providing blog and comment author avatars. Thanks to the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/openname/\" target=\"_blank\">Opennname plugin for WordPress</a>, site administrators can now offer users the option to associate a Openname avatars with an account on self-hosted sites.</p>\n<p>In order to test the plugin, you&#8217;ll need to first sign up for an <a href=\"https://openname.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Openname</a> account (which requires an account at Onename or Namecoin).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/openname-profile.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39992]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/openname-profile.jpg?resize=1025%2C307\" alt=\"openname-profile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40190\" /></a></p>\n<p>After you install the Openname plugin on your WordPress site, any registered user will be able to elect to use his Openname avatar by visiting /wp-admin/profile.php. Once you add your Openname, the plugin will keep your WordPress avatar in sync (with a short delay) with your Openname Avatar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/openname-settings.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39992]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/openname-settings.jpg?resize=720%2C264\" alt=\"openname-settings\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40191\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Openname plugin was created by <a href=\"https://www.larrysalibra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Salibra</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.pay4bugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pay4Bugs</a>. I tested it and found it to work as advertised.</p>\n<p>In the future, once the Openname Auth is more developed, it would be awesome if Salibra added this to his WordPress plugin. Onename might do well to create its own official plugin for this. Given that WordPress currently powers 23% of the world&#8217;s websites, an official Openname authentication plugin might bring wider adoption for its decentralized identity system.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 23:30:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: WordPress Publishes Security White Paper\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=40096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-publishes-security-white-paper\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3694:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40096]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg?resize=1024%2C514\" alt=\"photo credit: Lock - (license)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-40187\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/58441544@N00/2660230441\">Lock</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>As WordPress currently powers 23% of the web, the platform&#8217;s security is constantly under scrutiny.

Many consultants have had the experience of clients who are considering WordPress but are wondering if it&#8217;s secure. This document was created both for decision makers who are evaluating WordPress and developers who are building on top of the software.</p>\n<p>The document is available as a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Security-White-Paper/blob/master/WordPressSecurityWhitePaper.pdf?raw=true\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a>, and here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll find inside:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This document is an analysis and explanation of the WordPress core software development and its related security processes, as well as an examination of the inherent security built directly into the software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The white paper gives an introduction to the core leadership team, the WordPress Security Team, how a release cycle works, and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. The second half of the document covers common security vulnerabilities and how WordPress protects itself against those potential risks.</p>\n<p>Just like WordPress itself, the security white paper is open to contribution.

The book is <a title=\"https://github.com/WordPress/book/tree/master/Content\" href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/book/tree/master/Content\">divided into six parts</a> that contain a few chapters each.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordPressBookChapters.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40148]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40152\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordPressBookChapters.png?resize=1025%2C432\" alt=\"Chapters Of The WordPress History Book\" /></a>Chapters Of The WordPress History Book\n<p>If you come across any errors while reading the book, you can submit corrections by creating a pull request or an issue on the tracker. Here are a few things to look out for as you read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Factual errors: notes about factual errors are welcome. All suggestions for changes should be evidenced with links that back up any claims. Any facts that cannot be corroborated will not be included.</li>\n<li>Clarity: any paragraphs or sections that you feel are not clear. This would be of particular help in sections that are technical in nature.</li>\n<li>Omissions: anything that you feel has been omitted or not sufficiently covered. Note that this is a lengthy piece of writing and many issues have to be condensed to ensure that it is a manageable and interesting read. Suggestions about omissions should be accompanied with information about why it should be included, and backed up with evidence as to their importance.</li>\n<li>Images: if you have any images that you feel would complement the text, we&#8217;d love to have them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>McKeown is also looking for help writing haikus. Ideally, she&#8217;d like one for the book&#8217;s opening and one for each section. It will be published in two forms, a digital edition for the web and an e-book. McKeown also hinted at the possibility of printing physical copies, &#8220;We&#8217;re investigating different print options, so the feasibility of doing a print run or of offering print on demand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read a few chapters of the book already and it&#8217;s like a trip down memory lane.

In 2007, Buenos Aires hosted the first WordCamp outside the US. Despite hosting a few more WordCamps, the community lacked organization. Aldasoro explains how celebrating WordPress&#8217; 10th anniversary brought the right group of people together:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When WordPress turned 10, in May of 2013, thanks to a banner in the Codex site we created a celebration meetup. More than 20 people showed up, and the good thing was that we were a bunch of geeks on the same track. We had the people but we were lacking an organization. The ones interested in having an organized community kept in touch, we formed WordPress Argentina (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpargentina\" target=\"_blank\">@wpargentina</a>) and during 2014 we started to hold more formal monthly meetups.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the things I noticed is that several of the people <a title=\"https://kinsta.com/learn/wordpress-communities-around-the-world/\" href=\"https://kinsta.com/learn/wordpress-communities-around-the-world/\">featured in the article</a> use Facebook groups for communication. Although a number of US based WordPress meetups use <a title=\"http://www.meetup.com/\" href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a>, in other countries, Facebook appears to be the dominant way to communicate and organize members.</p>\n<p>Meetups are grassroots efforts that help WordPress reach every corner of the globe. As Matt Mullenweg said during his 2014 <a title=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/10/26/matt-mullenweg-the-state-of-the-word-2014/\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/10/26/matt-mullenweg-the-state-of-the-word-2014/\">State of The Word presentation</a>, &#8220;Organizing a meetup is one of the hardest things to do in terms of contributing to WordPress. Every single month, you have to come up with new stuff.&#8221; Those who help maintain community as a pillar of WordPress&#8217; success are helping to maintain its growth and popularity.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting to think about the enormous amount of WordPress education, contributions, and learning that takes place across the world everyday, thanks in large part to people like those featured in the article. It&#8217;s wonderful to see so many WordPress communities around the world growing in size to the point of  having their own WordCamps.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble organizing a WordPress meetup in your area, let us know in the comments. Thousands of people across the world access the Tavern on a daily basis and we might be able to help connect you to others in your area.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 05:16:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Kanye on Color\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44745\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"http://ma.tt/2015/03/kanye-on-color/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:955:\"<p><a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/03/pink-and-blue/\">Speaking of color masculinity</a>, here&#8217;s Kanye on creativity, society, and color from <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2012/11/29/kanye-west-im-amazing\">his 2008 FADER interview</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I feel like all the words are in you, you’re just blocking yourself, you’re blocking your creativity. Society has put up so many boundaries, so many limitations on what’s right and wrong that it’s almost impossible to get a pure thought out. It’s like a little kid, a little boy, looking at colors, and no one told him what colors are good, before somebody tells you you shouldn’t like pink because that’s for girls, or you’d instantly become a gay two-year-old. Why would anyone pick blue over pink? Pink is obviously a better color. Everyone’s born confident, and everything’s taken away from you. So many people try to put their personality on someone else.</p></blockquote>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 04:19:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 182 – John James Jacoby Talks BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://wptavern.com?p=40127&preview_id=40127\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-182-john-james-jacoby-talks-buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2988:\"<p><a title=\"http://jjj.me/\" href=\"http://jjj.me/\">John James Jacoby</a> is nearly halfway through his <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development-campaign-is-now-fully-funded\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development-campaign-is-now-fully-funded\">six month development cycle</a> on <a title=\"https://buddypress.org/\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/\">BuddyPress</a>, <a title=\"https://bbpress.org/\" href=\"https://bbpress.org/\">bbPress</a>, and <a title=\"http://blog.glotpress.org/\" href=\"http://blog.glotpress.org/\">GlotPress</a>. So, <a title=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\" href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I invited him on the show to give us an update on how things are progressing. On average, WordPress Weekly is an hour-long. This episode however, is two hours and nine minutes, but is filled with deep conversations surrounding each project.</p>\n<p>In this episode, we learn the history of BuddyPress and how its connection to WordPress MU (WordPress Multisite), influenced the project&#8217;s direction. Jacoby explains what GlotPress is and why its a cornerstone of the WordPress project. We discuss the future of comments on the web and the role bbPress can play in turning things around. Last but not least, we discuss whether Jacoby&#8217;s successful crowdfunding campaign has opened the door for others who need funding to work on open source projects.</p>\n<h2>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h2>\n<p><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/\">BuddyPress Identicons</a> automatically replaces default avatars with GitHub-style identicons.

Fans of the open source container technology appreciate that it&#8217;s lightweight, super fast to boot up, and easy to share containers through the <a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Hub</a>.</p>\n<p>Docker standardizes an app platform and its dependencies so you can hand the box over to another party without worrying about conflicting dependencies or differences between machines. While virtual machines can be rather weighty with an application plus an entire guest operating system, Docker is much lighter, containing just the application and its dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Introducing Wocker</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/vagrant-1-6.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant 1.6.0</a>, released last May, introduced support for Docker-based development environments, enabling Vagrant to manage them within Docker-powered Linux containers, instead of virtual machines.</p>\n<p>WordPress developers who want to incorporate Docker into their workflow now have a new tool at their disposal. <a href=\"http://wckr.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Wocker</a> is a Docker-based rapid development environment of WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you already have Vagrant, VirtualBox, and the vagrant-hostsupdater plugin installed, then getting started with Wocker takes next to no time. Simply clone the Wocker repository:</p>\n<p><code>$ git clone https://github.com/wckr/wocker.git &#038;&#038; cd wocker</code></p>\n<p>Then run <code>vagrant up</code>.  You can now navigate to your Wocker development site at: <a href=\"http://wocker.dev/\" target=\"blank\">http://wocker.dev/</a>. Here you&#8217;ll find the latest version of WordPress installed with the default theme active.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wocker.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40090]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wocker.png?resize=1025%2C650\" alt=\"wocker\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40093\" /></a></p>\n<p>Running a new Wocker container takes just three seconds:</p>\n<p><code>core@wocker ~ $ wocker run --name wp</code></p>\n<p>The tasks of creating a new container, restarting a stopped container, or shutting down, can all be done in a matter of seconds with <a href=\"http://wckr.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Wocker commands</a>.</p>\n<h3>Kite Koga on Creating Wocker</h3>\n<p>Japanese WordPress developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ixkaito\" target=\"_blank\">Kite Koga</a> created Wocker to speed up his own development. Koga is also the organizer of the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordCampKansai2015\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Kansai 2015</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I used to use MAMP and VCCW for developing on WordPress,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;MAMP is simple and easy but I have to download or copy WordPress core and create a database every time. <a href=\"http://vccw.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">VCCW</a> is a great tool, and I still use it now and then. It has a lot of options and functions but takes awhile to provision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Koga also experimented with using <a href=\"https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV\" target=\"_blank\">VVV</a> before creating Wocker. &#8220;Maybe VVV is good for developing WordPress core, but I feel it&#8217;s not fit for developing on WordPress. It takes too long to provision every time,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I found that Docker was a good choice for me,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;Once I have a Docker image, it takes only three seconds for every new WordPress container. However, Docker is a little tricky, and the command line is complex. Therefore, I made the Wocker command line to run containers and sync files with local more easily.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wocker is intentionally simple and limited to just a handful of options, as Koga&#8217;s primary objective was to make it super fast to create a new WordPress development environment. One drawback is that you cannot run two or more containers at the same time, but it takes just seconds to switch between containers.</p>\n<p>Koga summarized the main reasons that he opted to use Vagrant to manage Docker deployments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I could write some provision scripts in the Vagrantfile, so users only have to do `$ vagrant up`</li>\n<li>It was easier to map hostnames to IP addresses.</li>\n<li>Vagrant with CoreOS was simpler to manage Docker images and containers than boot2docker.</li>\n<li>To sync files between local machine, virtual machine, and the Docker container was tricky, so I made Wocker commands to make it easier.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to test out Wocker and find that it&#8217;s not for you, it&#8217;s easy and fast to uninstall. Simply run <code>$ vagrant destroy</code> to remove the Wocker folder, and your local machine will always be clean.</p>\n<p>I tested Wocker and found that it was insanely fast to create new containers (as well as restart existing ones), a task for which I would require an extra utility (such as <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/variable-vvv-a-new-vvv-site-creation-wizard-for-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Variable VVV</a>) to perform with VVV. If you find VVV to be too slow and want to check out an alternative, <a href=\"http://wckr.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Wocker</a> provides a faster way to set up simple development environments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Mar 2015 00:52:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe Now Taking Applications for 2016 Host City\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=40057\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-now-taking-applications-for-2016-host-city\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4150:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wceu-volunteers.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40057]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wceu-volunteers.jpg?resize=1025%2C485\" alt=\"wceu-volunteers\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31631\" /></a></p>\n<p>Organizing an event the size of <a href=\"http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe</a> is a year-round endeavor. The 2015 event is just four months away, speaker applications are closed, and the organization team is already asking for applications for the next host city. So far, the camp has been held in Leiden and Sofia, and will come to Seville in June.</p>\n<p>Applying to host WordCamp Europe is similar to applying to be an Olympic city. Local WordPress communities in potential host cities must submit applications, including a budget and a convincing plan. Organizers scrutinize the applications for the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preparation of the budget and venue research</li>\n<li>Strength of the local WordPress community</li>\n<li>The merits of the new location, as compared to the previous year</li>\n<li>Affordability for attendees</li>\n<li>Potential travel difficulties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This year <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/seville-spain-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Seville, Spain was selected as the host city</a> after a short bidding process. WordCamp Central requested the event be scheduled earlier in the year to avoid calendar conflicts. This was an unusual turn of events but organizers are committed to re-instituting a public bidding process for all future events.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe to Pilot New Organizer Mentorship Program</h3>\n<p>For months in advance, an all-star lineup of WordCamp organizers from around Europe put their heads together, sharing their experiences to plan the best event possible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Organizing WordCamp Europe is both a pleasure and a challenge,&#8221; co-organizer Petya Raykovska told the Tavern. &#8220;What’s great about it is that you get to work with experienced WordCamp organizers from across Europe. Each organizer brings their own knowledge and perspective to the organizing team which makes it a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The event has traditionally highlighted the diversity of the European WordPress community and its <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014\" target=\"_blank\">attendees&#8217; eagerness to connect beyond boundaries</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a challenge because each of us has our own way of doing things and we have to learn how to listen to each other and compromise,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;And, of course, there are all of those idioms that don’t cross language and cultural barriers!&#8221;</p>\n<p>New WordCamp Europe organizers should be equipped with a solid grasp of diplomacy and the ability to work with others across cultural differences.</p>\n<p>This year the current organization team plans to experiment with a mentorship program that would prepare the next crop of organizers to take the helm in 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re introducing a new process that we hope will help not only find the best team for next year, but will also be a pilot for a mentorship program for future WordCamp Europe (or any large 600+ people WordPress event) events,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So what we want to do in 2015 is choose the team for 2016 and get them to work with us for the 2015 edition, so they can get to know what it takes, get introduced to the processes, work closely with the existing team and monitor what&#8217;s required of the local team.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Current organizers are prioritizing mentoring new additions in order to create a seamless transition from one organizational team to the next. Instead of learning the ropes at the last minute, new organizers will have the opportunity to see how it works without all of the pressure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe it will be highly beneficial for them and will ensure smooth sailing for next year&#8217;s organisation,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 19:32:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: New Theme Development Company Makes First Sale Minutes After Being Approved on ThemeForest\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=40045\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"http://wptavern.com/new-theme-development-company-makes-first-sale-minutes-after-being-approved-on-themeforest\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4372:\"<p><a title=\"http://warriorsofcode.com/\" href=\"http://warriorsofcode.com/\">Warriors Of Code</a> is a new WordPress theme development shop in Australia. An employee who goes by the name <a title=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/genesisfan\" href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/genesisfan\">Genesisfan</a> on Reddit, <a title=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2xs8l2/just_had_our_first_wordpress_theme_accepted_at/\" href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2xs8l2/just_had_our_first_wordpress_theme_accepted_at/\">published a post </a>explaining how the company recently had its first theme accepted on ThemeForest and was willing to answer questions others had about the experience. According to the post, he spent the better part of six months with a designer he hired while working a full-time job developing <a title=\"http://themeforest.net/item/broadsword-a-wordpress-theme-to-share-stories/full_screen_preview/10514496\" href=\"http://themeforest.net/item/broadsword-a-wordpress-theme-to-share-stories/full_screen_preview/10514496\">Broadsword</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BroadSword.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[40045]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40046\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BroadSword.png?resize=1025%2C496\" alt=\"BroadSword Single Page View\" /></a>BroadSword Single Page View\n<p>When asked what he thought of the ThemeForest submission and review process, he responded, &#8220;We were pleasantly surprised with how quickly they turned around our review, and the level of detail they provided in their soft rejection. Aside from some technicalities that we&#8217;d missed (being more specific about what features we supported), the biggest issue was that we were missing some data validation in our files. Make sure you use the esc_ and sanitize_ functions provided by WordPress!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once the issues were addressed, ThemeForest approved the submission and the team made its first sale within minutes of it going live. When asked what makes their theme different in the marketplace, he responded, &#8220;We kept the theme options to a minimum. We were both pretty tired of themes that include a thousand options and tend to be more like frameworks than standalone themes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Based on <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/envato-continues-to-rake-in-the-cash-from-wordpress-themes-packaged-as-complete-website-solutions\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/envato-continues-to-rake-in-the-cash-from-wordpress-themes-packaged-as-complete-website-solutions\">stats that highlight</a> how well ThemeForest is doing, it&#8217;s not surprising that Warriors of code made their first sale within minutes of going live. However, the company used social media to its advantage, so it&#8217;s possible one their followers purchased the theme based on tweets. In fact, the company explains how they handled promotion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Regarding promotion, we&#8217;ve been tweeting it out and liking the facebook page we&#8217;ve set up and luckily, it&#8217;s now trending on ThemeForest. It helps that I&#8217;m on the east coast of Canada and my partner is in Sydney, Australia, so we&#8217;re able to pretty much cover comment replies quickly at any time of the day. I think that goes a long way to helping promote a positive vibe about the theme.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After 24 hours, the company has six sales at $43 each. It&#8217;s not a huge amount, but it&#8217;s a start. The big takeaways is that ThemeForest reviews are catching insecure coding practices and making the first sale is a quick endeavor, especially if you already have a social media presence. The company <a title=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2xs8l2/just_had_our_first_wordpress_theme_accepted_at/\" href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/2xs8l2/just_had_our_first_wordpress_theme_accepted_at/\">answers several other questions</a> related to the experience.</p>\n<p>We know that in this instance, ThemeForest did its job to discover insecure coding practices during reviews. It&#8217;s also refreshing to hear from an up and coming theme company that they&#8217;re tired of theme options. I haven&#8217;t used their product so I can&#8217;t confirm if its claims are true, but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction to see other ThemeForest sellers make such statements in public.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 07:33:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Matt: WIRED Re-launch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44764\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://ma.tt/2015/03/wired-re-launch/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2726:\"<p>There&#8217;s the smart publishers, and then there&#8217;s the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/02/developer-employment-act/\">ones going out of business</a>. WIRED is one of the smart ones, and just launched an awesome redesign on WordPress. <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/03/our-new-site/\">From their editor-in-chief</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in 1994 we launched Hotwired, the first site with original editorial content created for the web. It was a digital home for reporting on the future of science, business, design, and technology. You’ve come to trust us over the past two decades, but our growth online has sometimes come too quickly and with some pain. When I took over as editor in chief in 2012, WIRED had an archive of more than 100,000 stories. That’s good! But they were spread out over more than a dozen different databases, sections, and homepages tenuously connected by virtual duct tape and chewing gum. The cleanup process—onerous and without a shred of glamour—took almost 15 months. But finally, last year, our engineers rolled out a newly unified site architecture built atop a single streamlined WordPress installation. And you didn’t notice a hiccup. Maybe you saw that pages loaded a touch faster. Stories looked more WIRED.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The story of <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/03/wired-dot-com-from-the-devs/\">the engineering behind it from Kathleen Vignos is also cool</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The redesign gives us the third incarnation of our Curator application, which started years ago as a separate Groovy on Grails application maintained by a single Java developer. Curator once consumed articles from 35 different blogs for curation on our homepage. When we migrated our 17 active WordPress blogs into one WordPress install, we also rewrote Curator in Cake PHP to match our WordPress PHP backend. After this, anyone on our team could maintain Curator—but the architecture remained the same and lived outside of WordPress. Using this version of Curator, our web producer team manually constructed the homepage throughout each day as various stories were ready to be promoted.</p>\n<p>Our new and improved Curator is now a custom WordPress plugin—and it’s artificially intelligent! This allows our homepage and section landing pages to be both automated and curated at the same time. Stories flow through automagically based on editorial criteria, but editors can take control of the flow by locking stories in certain slots in our card system. This means our homepage and section landing pages are constantly changing with new stories all day long.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Curator sounds cool, as does the coming &#8220;longform feature article builder.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 02:36:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Ninja Forms 2.9 Ships With Major Performance Improvements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"http://wptavern.com/ninja-forms-2-9-ships-with-major-performance-improvements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5648:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NinjaFormsFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39995]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-40019\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NinjaFormsFeaturedImage.png?resize=840%2C273\" alt=\"Ninja Forms Featured Image\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ninja Forms <a title=\"https://ninjaforms.com/version-2-9/\" href=\"https://ninjaforms.com/version-2-9/\">2.9 is available</a> and features an improved user experience along with major performance enhancements. One of the biggest performance problems 2.9 solves is handling large forms. Prior to 2.9, users had to edit a php.ini file to handle the increased amount of server resources needed to process long forms, something many shared webhosts don&#8217;t allow. According to Kevin Stover, lead developer of Ninja Forms, 2.9 not only solves this problem, but the form builder is more efficient overall.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In our local tests, a 578 field form was 12.8mb and took 33.52 seconds to load. (It also occasionally crashed our browser.) In version 2.9, the same form was only 1.2mb and took only 1.41 seconds to load. We call that progress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The user experience is vastly improved compared to earlier versions of the plugin. Now when you edit an existing form or want to create a new one, you&#8217;re taken to the form builder instead of a page filled with confusing settings. After installing Ninja Forms, it took less than five minutes to recreate the <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/contact-me\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/contact-me\">Tavern&#8217;s contact form</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NinjaForms29UserInterface.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39995]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40012\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NinjaForms29UserInterface.png?resize=1025%2C500\" alt=\"Ninja Forms 2.9 User Interface\" /></a>Ninja Forms 2.9 User Interface\n<p>A small but noticeable change is that, when you create a new form without a submit button and save it, a model window pops up reminding you to add one. Or, you can let Ninja Forms add it automatically. It&#8217;s hard to make a form useful without a submit button!</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NinjaForms29SubmitButtonReminder.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39995]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40013\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NinjaForms29SubmitButtonReminder.png?resize=549%2C268\" alt=\"Ninja Forms 2.9 Submit Button\" /></a>Ninja Forms 2.9 Submit Button Reminder\n<p>One of the major changes to the form building experience is configuring fields. In previous versions of Ninja Forms, all of the configuration options for fields were in view which felt overwhelming. In Ninja Forms 2.9, field options are hidden behind drop down menus that are closed by default.

More minor fixes are on deck for inclusion in the forthcoming 2.2.2 release.</p>\n<p>This week contributors identified priorities for new features and improvements to work on for the <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/bp-2-3-0-dev-cycle-contributor-priorities/\" target=\"_blank\">2.3 development cycle</a>. Updates to BuddyPress&#8217; existing APIs and work on the following new APIs commenced this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6210\" target=\"_blank\">New Invitations API</a> &#8211; a flexible API to create/retrieve invitations across components</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429\" target=\"_blank\">New Attachments API</a> &#8211; a new component to manage BuddyPress attachments</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/paulgibbs/buddypress/tree/posts2posts\" target=\"_blank\">Possible new Relationships API</a> &#8211; for the Favorites/Likes features</li>\n<li>Improvements to Member Types API &#8211; <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5192\" target=\"_blank\">ability to create member-type-specific xprofile fields</a>, fixes for existing bugs</li>\n<li>Notifications API &#8211; <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6257\" target=\"_blank\">add a metadata table</a> &#8211; useful for storing additional data outside the available notification table&#8217;s schema</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New APIs would make it possible for BuddyPress developers to build extensions that bring in more exciting features, such as a core-supported way to manage media/user galleries, local avatar management, invitation capabilities for groups, sites, blogs, docs, etc. The APIs give developers a way to custom tailor those experiences for their communities.</p>\n<p>While none of these APIs and improvements are yet guaranteed to make it into 2.3, contributors have hammered out the tickets they will be investing in during the next three months.

He&#8217;s one of three co-founders of WooThemes and was instrumental in <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/about/\">their growth</a> and success they achieved from 2008 until his departure in late 2013.</p>\n<p>Today, Adii is making the second step of his WordPress comeback. In addition to <a href=\"https://receiptful.com/\">Receiptful</a> &#8212; his new eCommerce receipts product &#8212; he&#8217;s taking on an advisory role with Obox, to go along with a cash investment in the company.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://oboxthemes.com/\">Obox</a> is based in Cape Town, South Africa &#8212; where Adii and WooThemes are also based. Obox has been around the block as well.</p>\n<p>They were founded in 2009 and are lead by brothers Marc and David Perel. Obox has experienced times of great success &#8212; peaking as a team of 8 in 2012 &#8212; and also years where they&#8217;ve scaled back in response to more competition and watering down of the WordPress theme market.</p>\n<p>Before Adii left WooThemes, he had numerous conversations with Obox about an acquisition, but the parties could never agree on the specifics.</p>\n<h3>Adii now owns a 30% stake in Obox</h3>\n<p>David Perel showed Adii some screenshots of Layers while they were wrapping up development of <a title=\"Layers, by Obox, introduces a beautiful page building interface\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/layers-theme-obox/\">the new product</a>. Adii was intrigued and they started once again talking about joining forces, except this time the direction changed; they started talking about what it would look like for Adii to join Obox.</p>\n<p>Adii has made a cash investment in the Obox team, in return for a 30% stake in the company. The investment gives Obox a valuation in the millions of dollars, &#8220;but less than $10 million.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The cash from Adii&#8217;s investment is largely going to be used for operating expenses for the Obox team as they create the business model around Layers. Obox has also beefed up their team by <a href=\"http://blog.oboxthemes.com/calyx-joins-obox/\">acquihiring Calyx</a>, a two man Cape Town agency.</p>\n<p>According to David, <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">&#8220;Every cent Obox raises and makes will go into Layers.&#8221;</span></p>\n<h3>Roller coaster ride</h3>\n<p>Adii has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride since his departure of WooThemes. I&#8217;ve heard both Adii and his cofounders (Magnus Jepson and Mark Forrester) describe their split as a divorce. It was a hard time.</p>\n<p>The split was complete, and Adii released all ownership of the company for an amount he has <a href=\"http://mixergy.com/interviews/adii-pienaar-public-beta-interview/\">confirmed on Mixergy</a> was seven figures. He tells me that he has been fully paid for his shares.</p>\n<p>With cash in hand, Adii had room to take some risks, and with that risk came a mixture of successes and failures. His first foray into another product was Public Beta, which had many iterations before he ultimately deemed it a lost cause.</p>\n<p>His latest startup seems to have traction; Receiptful has had a successful launch, is getting nice adoption, and is expanding to multiple eCommerce platforms after an initial WooCommerce-only launch.</p>\n<p>Time heals all wounds, and it appears Adii&#8217;s relationship with WooThemes is also mended. They even <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2015/02/why-customized-receipts-increase-ecommerce-revenue/\">blogged about Receiptful</a> recently on the main WooThemes blog.</p>\n<h3>Renewed passion for WordPress</h3>\n<p>Both Receiptful and the Obox investment show renewed passion for WordPress, as well as a sign of Adii getting back to his roots and what he knows best. With the launch of WooCommerce, Adii spearheaded what became a huge success during his time at WooThemes; and WooCommerce has only further grown since his departure.</p>\n<p>Adii hopes to take what he&#8217;s learned &#8212; both at WooThemes and with his adventures since &#8212; to his role at Obox.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the biggest challenges within WordPress is the disconnect between how developers and end-users use it, which makes building great WordPress products really hard. It&#8217;s also something that we encountered often at Woo and instead of truly tackling the problem we leaned towards building tools for developers.</p>\n<p>Layers is different in that sense, because it&#8217;s focused on the (end-)user experience from the ground up. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to work with David &amp; Marc to grow Layers, as they&#8217;re fanatical about UX and it&#8217;s my belief that they&#8217;ll finally make progress to closing the gap between a developer tool and end-user product.</p>\n<p>And in terms of the commercialisation of Layers&#8230; Well, let&#8217;s just say that I see opportunities and patterns that were prevalent in WooCommerce&#8217;s early days too&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<h3>A new step for a dynamic WordPress figure</h3>\n<p>Adii was a huge and dynamic figure in the early days of WordPress&#8217; commercial product space. He&#8217;s always made bold decisions &#8212; some good and some not so good.</p>\n<p>He has a penchant to make quick decisions and he iterates at a rapid pace; to some it can be off-putting, but for finding a hit it can be hugely important. In contrast, the Obox team makes calculated risks. While they&#8217;ve done a great deal of interesting work and experimentation on their own, they have largely stuck with the theme business while some of their early theme competitors rotated toward plugins and other verticals.</p>\n<p>I believe that the combination of Adii and the Perel brothers will make for a compelling trio of leadership at the helm for Obox. Their Layers launch <a href=\"http://blog.oboxthemes.com/what-hitting-the-top-spot-on-product-hunt-did-to-our-launch-day/\">certainly made waves</a>, and their next steps will be hugely important for the future of a company that has gone all in on a product without a monetization strategy.</p>\n<p>You can read the <a href=\"http://blog.oboxthemes.com/adii-co-founder-of-woothemes-and-woocommerce-has-joined-obox/\">official announcement on the Obox blog</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Mar 2015 15:56:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Launches New Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39957\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3778:\"<p>The WordPress.org Meta team is on a roll this month. Following the successful <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design\" target=\"_blank\">launch of the new theme directory</a>, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin directory</a> is getting the same treatment with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">a fresh coat of paint</a> and a set of brand new features.</p>\n<p>Browsing the official plugin directory is now similar to searching via the admin plugin browser. Having all of this code on hand made it easier for the meta team to replicate the experience in the directory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-plugin-directory.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39957]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-plugin-directory.png?resize=1025%2C970\" alt=\"wordpress-plugin-directory\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39963\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to the new design, the directory includes a new section for logged-in users to manage favorited plugins. Previously, users had to navigate to their own profile pages to access this information. With more than 36,000 listings in the directory, favorites are becoming an important feature for users who want to keep track of plugins they use frequently.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plugin-favorites.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39957]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plugin-favorites.png?resize=1025%2C511\" alt=\"plugin-favorites\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39975\" /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Popular&#8221; section seems to be populated by extensions with the highest number of active installs. It would be helpful to be able to further sort popular plugins based on different criteria, i.e. the most-favorited plugins and those with the highest ratings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">Beta Testing</a> is a new section which you may recognize from the WordPress admin. It lists all the feature plugins that are currently under consideration for inclusion in core at some point in the future. This more prominent display will help users discover the plugins, resulting in an increase in feedback for contributors.</p>\n<p>Users can also now search for plugins based on author, keyword, or tag. Searching is lightning fast, but it could be improved with filtering options to further narrow down the results.</p>\n<p>Although individual plugin pages did not receive a design update, they now reflect more accurate data with the number of active installs for each plugin. This provides plugin authors with a better understanding of how many sites are actively using that functionality, as opposed to just having downloaded it once and then uninstalled it.</p>\n<p>The new design is more visually-oriented than the previous one, making it easier for users to quickly scan through a long list of results.

Pickle is a restaurant theme that is packaged with a custom admin design to provide a seamless content-editing experience.</p>\n<p>Schuller&#8217;s decision to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jason-schuller-to-re-enter-wordpress-theme-market-with-niche-admin-designs\" target=\"_blank\">re-enter the WordPress theme market</a> following the sale of Press75 came after several years of experimenting with alternative publishing platforms. In an <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/interview-with-jason-schuller-founder-of-press75-com\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> with the Tavern last year, he expressed dissatisfaction with trying to make WordPress do what he wanted, which caused him to consider abandoning the platform entirely.</p>\n<p>Schuller found himself chronically at odds with WordPress&#8217; limitations for scaling its complexity backwards to provide a more simplified publishing experience. Pickle was born out of this frustration. The theme reimagines the WordPress admin as an extension of the front-end design, with no abrupt transitions for editing content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pickle-admin.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39892]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pickle-admin.jpg?resize=1025%2C682\" alt=\"pickle-admin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39907\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Targeting a Wider Market Beyond WordPress</h3>\n<p>At first glance, it might appear that the restaurant niche is a relatively small and limited market for a WordPress theme developer. However, if you check out <a href=\"https://pickle.pub/\" target=\"_blank\">Pickle.pub</a>, you&#8217;ll find no mention of WordPress among Pickle&#8217;s features. Schuller is intentionally marketing it to a larger potential customer base that includes anyone looking to build a simple restaurant website.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m not really advertising Pickle as a WordPress theme,&#8221; Schuller told the Tavern. &#8220;Essentially, my approach was to use WordPress to create my own custom CMS for minimalist restaurant websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the future he plans to release more options, styles and add-ons for the product. Currently, all of Pickle&#8217;s functionality is packed into the theme, but Schuller is not overly concerned about data portability in this instance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That data (in my opinion) is exclusive to what I’m doing with Pickle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In other words, <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">I’m not concerned with my users even knowing that it’s powered by WordPress.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schuller is hoping to attract two different markets: customers who know they want WordPress and those who just know they want a business website and don&#8217;t care what software it uses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It shouldn’t matter to new users if it’s a WordPress solution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But at the same time, freelancers who work with WordPress and have clients in the restaurant industry might be attracted by Pickle because it is a WordPress solution. I’m hoping to target both ends of the spectrum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This time around in the WordPress theme business, Schuller is venturing into the frontier where customers aren&#8217;t already convinced of a favorite CMS. Pickle was intentionally designed to make WordPress, and all its complexity, effectively invisible. This is one of the reasons the theme does not currently support the use of 3rd-party plugins.</p>\n<h3>At Odds with WordPress Theme Development Best Practices</h3>\n<p>WordPress core doesn&#8217;t make it easy for developers to heavily customize the admin. This will soon change when the WP REST API lands in core; Schuller is open to updating Pickle to use the API once it&#8217;s no longer under heavy development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once the REST API lands in core, there would be no reason for me not to change my approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But for today, a little custom CSS and PHP will do just fine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pickle is Schuller&#8217;s attempt at testing the waters for the possibility of other niche admin designs in the future. A hosted version is also set to launch within the next month. &#8220;If all goes well, I’ll probably create more niche solutions from the simple HTML templates I’ve been releasing on <a href=\"https://leeflets.com\" target=\"_blank\">Leeflets</a>,&#8221; he said. These include other one-page designs for things like newsletters, biographies, galleries, and landing or product pages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If that’s something I do end up doing, I would probably create some sort of admin theming plugin in order to eliminate duplicating the work each time,&#8221; Schuller said. &#8220;I could see the result of that being its own product as well for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the moment, he is not prioritizing putting the functionality into a plugin. However, the way Pickle is built is at odds with WordPress theme development best practices of separating plugin functionality from the theme&#8217;s design.</p>\n<p>If a major release of WordPress causes a break in Pickle, it&#8217;s not in a plugin where one could easily disable the functionality. A breaking change could possibly effect the site&#8217;s frontend design, without an update to Pickle. If the product were packaged as a theme plus plugin combination, users would be in a better position for updates from both core and Pickle.</p>\n<p>Schuller contends that WordPress theme developers should have the option to add features in a more modular fashion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I realize that my approach for Pickle specifically probably isn&#8217;t the way most “WordPress” developers would have done it. The important thing is that I finished it, and the idea is out there regardless of how it was engineered. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always felt that a good CMS should reflect the functionality you need for any given project. For instance, we shouldn&#8217;t assume that all themes should support links, comments, widgets, etc., or even posts for that matter. Some themes/users might only need &#8220;pages&#8221; which means that most of the admin menus in WordPress could and maybe should be hidden in that case. We have to manually add &#8220;theme support&#8221; within theme functions for features like &#8220;post thumbnails&#8221;, so why isn&#8217;t that the case for everything else?</p></blockquote>\n<p>After years of frustration with &#8220;the WordPress way,&#8221; Schuller is going his own way this time around. He finds himself at friction with WordPress best practices and the ability to serve a larger market of people who don&#8217;t care if a site is built on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I really wasn’t concerned about what the WordPress developer community would think about how I engineered Pickle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know there are probably so many ways I could have done it better, or hired someone else to do it better for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In creating Pickle, Schuller consciously chose to ignore his fear of the doing_it_wrong() brigade in order to deliver a product that he believes will be simple for customers to use.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I got started with WordPress back in 2007, I had no clue what I was doing, but I was creating things and putting them out there as I learned, which is how I grew Press75. Somewhere along the way, I became much too concerned with how the WordPress community might perceive what I was making and that’s when my business started to decline. </p>\n<p>Instead of just being happy making things I was passionate about, I became obsessed with perfection and making sure everyone was going be happy with what I made. I’m not going to make that same mistake again. It’s so much more important to put your work out there (even if it’s not perfect) than to never put it out there at all in fear that someone might not agree with the way you did it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Could business be as simple as building products that make both you and your customer happy? Do all WordPress sites need a long-term plan for data portability and separation of theme and plugin functionality?</p>\n<h3>Re-Imagining WordPress as an Invisible CMS</h3>\n<p>The invisibility of the traditional admin in the Pickle theme is a tribute to WordPress&#8217; flexibility as a CMS. However, the lack of theme/plugin functionality separation is my primary objection to how it&#8217;s built, as it may make it difficult for the user to keep pace with core updates. This could potentially become a security issue.</p>\n<p>Schuller&#8217;s approach for one-page designs may not conform to best practices but it once again begs the question: how can we erase the separation between editing experience and the display of content? Many users find the native customizer in its current state to be too clunky to adequately handle this in an elegant way.</p>\n<p>While I don&#8217;t fully support the approach that Schuller took with building Pickle, I agree with the basic premise of pushing the boundaries to simplify WordPress for the user. Pickle is inspirational, despite its technical drawbacks. It is a groundbreaking example of a WordPress-powered content editing experience that is perfectly tailored to the frontend design. It&#8217;s a design-specific theme that doesn&#8217;t require a heavy page builder or multiple sub-panels of customizer options.</p>\n<p>Not everyone agrees on the best way to make the WordPress editing experience better while moving theme development forward. The platform needs people who are dissatisfied with the status quo to spearhead new, unorthodox ways of solving problems. However, it also needs the folks who have managed to keep inspiration alive for years, while working on the less glamorous tasks of contributing to core and establishing standards to make it better for everyone.</p>\n<p>As niche admin designs become common, the answer to the question of &#8220;What does WordPress look like?&#8221; will get fuzzy and difficult to define. A more modular approach to theming WordPress as a whole will make it easier for developers to sift out the functionality that users don&#8217;t need on basic websites. Finding a happy balance here will be critical for the platform to continue its reputation as a user-friendly CMS.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 23:51:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: There Can Only Be One Sticky Post\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39916\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://wptavern.com/there-can-only-be-one-sticky-post\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1817:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/StickyPostPollFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39916]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-39338\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/StickyPostPollFeaturedImage.png?resize=670%2C294\" alt=\"Sticky Posts Poll Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37996585435@N01/6369443095\">Free Thinking at the Sage, Gateshead</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Last month, we <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress\">polled our readers</a> to find out how many use the sticky posts feature in WordPress.

There Can Only Be One is Jones&#8217; first plugin submitted to the plugin directory and he&#8217;s interested to hear any feedback or suggestions you have to improve it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 22:04:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordCamp St. Louis, MO, March 14th-15 Will Have a Kids Camp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39883\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-st-louis-mo-march-14th-15-will-have-a-kids-camp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3758:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordCampStLouis2015FeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39883]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39884\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WordCampStLouis2015FeaturedImage.png?resize=754%2C218\" alt=\"WordCamp St Louis 2015 Featured Image\" /></a><a title=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/\" href=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp St. Louis</a>, MO, takes place on March 14th-15th on the <a title=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/location/\" href=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/location/\">campus of Washington University</a>. Tickets are <a title=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/\" href=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/\">still available</a> for $25 which covers both days and gets you a T-Shirt, access to events, the after party, and community day.</p>\n<p>The event features two days of learning about WordPress with <a title=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/\" href=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/\">four tracks of sessions</a>. Two tracks are dedicated to developers while the other two are devoted to users.

Community day is similar to a WordPress contributor day in that there will be plenty of opportunities to learn, network, and share information. The schedule for community day looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keynote </strong>by a well-know member of the WP community</li>\n<li><strong>Kids Camp</strong> a class geared towards 8-13 year olds, however, any age is welcome to attend (space permitting). Parents must be present for children under 13 and all attendees must bring a laptop. Up to 3 children under the age of 18 can attend without charge for each paid adult (parent) ticket.</li>\n<li><strong>Hackathon</strong> help developers, designers, and other attendees on creating or improving local organization’s presence on the web (the list of specific organizations will be announced later, if you know of someone who might benefit <a title=\"Contact\" href=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/contact/\">drop us a line</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>All-day happiness bar:</strong> come and learn with the best!</li>\n<li><strong>Give back to Core:</strong> members of the plugin and theme review team as well as core contributors will be on hand to help you give back to the global WordPress community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/kids-camp/\" href=\"http://stlouis.wordcamp.org/2015/session/kids-camp/\">Kids Camp</a> takes place on community day from 9am to noon and will cover the basics of setting up a site and what it means to publish to the web. The class is geared towards 8-13 year olds, but any age is welcome to attend. Parents or legal guardians must be present for children under 12 and all attendees must bring a laptop. Also on Sunday, <a title=\"http://halfelf.org/\" href=\"http://halfelf.org/\">Mika Epstein</a> will give a keynote presentation that explains how to fit into the WordPress community by being true to yourself.</p>\n<p>I will be in attendance so if you see me, please stop and say hi as I&#8217;d love to chat with you.

We all started talking over a Christmas meetup and this is what happened from that.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Exploring the Future of Theming Beyond Specific Platforms</h3>\n<p>The conference will focus on theming for open source applications such as WordPress, Drupal, Ghost, and Joomla. Themers of all experience levels are welcome, as are front-end developers who are interested in theming. The topics for the first year will be focused around the future of theming.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope to bring a wide range of talks under that banner,&#8221; Lister said. &#8220;We are currently curating our schedule, but it’s shaping up to be really interesting and diverse. We are planning on making it a place themers can go to get inspired.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In selecting the sessions, organizers hope to further delve into the technologies and styles, beyond specific platforms, to explore the future of theming. They also plan to incorporate talks on performance and user experience.</p>\n<p>Jack Lenox wants to focus the event around some of the most recent and significant shifts in theming and front-end development. &#8220;These go beyond the platform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;From REST APIs, to new design directions and into the burgeoning ecosystem of the new JavaScript tools such as React &#8211; tools that allow us to build engaging, human user experiences alongside a REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As one platform cannot possibly hold a monopoly on technical innovation, it&#8217;s important for designers and developers to venture outside the bubble of their primary platform in order to stay on the cutting edge. ThemeConf organizers are aiming to facilitate cross-platform collaboration and knowledge sharing to help attendees explore a wide range of topics.</p>\n<p>The event will be non-profit, with any proceeds going into the next year and/or donated to the local area. The 101-year-old Alhambra Cinema is an intimate venue that will be limited to 150 attendees.

The number of total downloads has been replaced with the number of active installs. While the numbers are not exact, they&#8217;re close enough to give people insight into usage.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ActiveDownloadCounts.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39846]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-39849\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ActiveDownloadCounts.png?resize=267%2C145\" alt=\"Active Sites\" /></a>Active Sites\n<p>When it comes to reporting WordPress plugin security vulnerabilities, this is a welcome change. The active install numbers give the media a better idea on how many sites are potentially at risk.

A majority of sites are using older versions of plugins. For all of the effort that goes into informing users to keep sites up to date as a bare essential security practice, these are sobering statistics.</p>\n<h2>Time to Auto Update All The Things</h2>\n<p>While I realize there isn&#8217;t always an immediate need to update a plugin <strong>unless it&#8217;s a security release</strong>, it&#8217;s a good idea to keep them updated regardless. These statistics indicate that the only way to keep as many sites as possible updated is to forcefully turn on automatic updates for major releases, minor releases, plugins, and themes.</p>\n<p>A move like this would likely generate a lot of push back, especially from those <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/how-will-you-configure-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-will-you-configure-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7\">who already don&#8217;t like</a> WordPress&#8217; current implementation since there&#8217;s not an option in the WordPress backend to configure them. However, the numbers indicate that millions of sites are running outdated code by choice which is unacceptable.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SafetyFirstAutoUpdates.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39846]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-39852\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SafetyFirstAutoUpdates.png?resize=592%2C293\" alt=\"Safety First auto Updates\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/8399025@N07/2146968879\">Rescue device</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>The WordPress development team is in a position to help make the web safer for everyone.

In late 2013, <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/ithemes-acquires-better-wp-security-plugin-and-hires-wordpress-security-expert-chris-wiegman\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/ithemes-acquires-better-wp-security-plugin-and-hires-wordpress-security-expert-chris-wiegman\">iThemes acquired Better WP Security</a> and changed its name to iThemes Security. As part of the deal, Wiegman was brought on board to continue developing the plugin.</p>\n<h2>Wiegman Moves From Products Back to Client Work</h2>\n<p>Joining <a title=\"http://10up.com/\" href=\"http://10up.com/\">10up</a> gives Wiegman the opportunity to take what he&#8217;s learned from developing iThemes Security and apply it to client sites. He notes two huge reasons for the move: burnout and losing focus on <strong>why</strong> he was developing the product.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To put it simply I was bored and burned out with the plugin. If I’m really going to be honest this was the case when I sold it to iThemes in 2013 and at the time I truly believed that working on it full-time would somehow renew my interest but that wasn’t the case. This is not to say I didn’t have a passion for it but just that I really wanted to work on other things and not just the plugin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is an interesting move, because generally I see a lot of WordPress consultants branch away from client work to focus on products. In this case, a product driven developer has decided to go back to client work for the variety and educational opportunities it offers.</p>\n<h2>The Future of iThemes Security</h2>\n<p>Since its creation, Wiegman has been the face of Better WP Security and iThemes Security. iThemes CEO, Cory Miller, has this to say about Wiegman&#8217;s work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We thank Chris Wiegman for his contribution to iThemes Security (formerly known as Better WP Security) and his time at iThemes. We hope to make him proud of leaving such an awesome project in our hands. We are committed to making iThemes Security the easiest tool to allow people to protect and secure their WordPress websites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also explains that while Wiegman is no longer with the company, iThemes will continue to develop the plugin, &#8220;One benefit of iThemes having been around for seven years now, with a 20-plus person team, is having &#8216;bench strength&#8217; or rather, people who are able and available to take over projects such as iThemes Security in the event someone moves on to another opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a title=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisbliss18/\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisbliss18/\">Chris Jean</a> along with <a title=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron Campbell</a> will take over development of iThemes Security.

While the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" target=\"_blank\">stats page</a> looks much the same as before, more sophisticated methods of collecting and processing the data have been put in place, thanks to the efforts of WordPress.org contributor <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32\" target=\"_blank\">Dion Hulse</a>. The results are a dramatic shift in the data reported.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-stats.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39800]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wordpress-stats.jpg?resize=733%2C634\" alt=\"wordpress-stats\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-39811\" /></a></p>\n<h3>More Than 1/3 of Sites Running on WordPress 4.1</h3>\n<p>One of the most notable differences is the percentage of sites that are running the latest version of WordPress. Things are not quite as grim as previous stats indicated. Prior to the update, WordPress was reporting fewer than 10% of sites running on 4.1. After eliminating data for sites that are no longer online, the new data shows roughly 36% of sites running on the latest version.</p>\n<p>Andrew Nacin explained how the new stats are collected and interpreted into the updated pie chart:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thousands of new WordPress sites come online every day. Some others, though, stop pinging over time. The new data only reflects sites that have pinged api.wordpress.org within the last few months. There were also plenty of other inconsistencies in the data that we&#8217;ve been able to resolve, which has resulted in numbers we feel are more consistent and accurate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other major shifts in the data demonstrate that there are very few sites still lingering on WordPress 3.0, which was released in June 2010. Sites running on 3.0 were previously reported as 16.06% but are now ringing in at just 2.27%.</p>\n<p>The same goes for PHP 5.2 usage, which was previously reported at an alarming 31.76%. More accurate data puts this figure at 16.60%. This is likely due to eliminating sites that haven&#8217;t pinged api.wordpress.org within the last few months.</p>\n<p>While the PHP version usage outlook is no longer as bleak as previous data indicated, Nacin said it isn&#8217;t enough to change the minimum required for WordPress core:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One-sixth of all sites running PHP 5.2 is still many millions of sites. If we move the PHP minimum version too early, we risk stranding millions of installs on older versions of WordPress.</p>\n<p>So, I wish to note that this does not change our calculations for keeping PHP 5.2 as the minimum for WordPress core — we had these numbers available to us when preparing our 2015 plans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new stats are a welcome update to many involved in supporting and updating WordPress sites, but several commenters requested a more detailed cross of PHP version as compared to the WordPress version that sites are using.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\">@miss_jwo</a> I\'ve been whining about seeing a cross for literally years&#8230; :)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrey Savchenko (@Rarst) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rarst/status/572400268467408896\">March 2, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WordPress developer Josh Pollock <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/01/major-update-to-our-version-stats-for-php-mysql-and-wordpress/#comment-7656\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the announcement post with the same question: &#8220;Is there anyway we can see PHP/MySQL versions broken down by what WordPress version they are running on? It would be interesting to see what percentage of users running an EOLed version of PHP are choosing to stay on old WordPress versions of their own accord/lack of action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I checked with Andrew Nacin, who confirmed that this data is available and will be made public at some point in the future. &#8220;We&#8217;re still working on ensuring the numbers are stable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty predictable: older WP versions have more people on older PHP and MySQL versions. Newer WP versions have less.&#8221;  There&#8217;s currently no set timeline for delivering the additional stats, but WordPress.org contributors have more data in the works.</p>\n<h3>WordPress is Urging Hosting Companies to Use More Recent Versions of PHP</h3>\n<p>The WordPress project continues to work with hosting companies to urge them to update their PHP version offering to  5.4+. This is a slow but necessary process before WordPress can raise the minimum required PHP version, which Nacin said is ultimately part of the plan:</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHP 5.2 is at about 16% for all installs right now. It&#8217;s at about 10% for installs running WordPress 4.1, but because 4.1 is such a large part of the pie (36%), it&#8217;s the WP version with the most PHP 5.2 installs.</p>\n<p>Our goals remain the same: priority 1 is to update old WordPress installs, priority 2 is to update old PHP and MySQL. Only once the numbers drastically move as a result of our efforts would any minimum requirement change. We cannot risk abandoning so many users on older WordPress and PHP versions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ensuring the accuracy of WordPress usage stats is a major milestone. At the moment, the number of users on PHP 5.2 is far too high to consider a minimum requirement change any time soon. However, Nacin said that hosts have so far been very responsive to WordPress&#8217; urges to update PHP versions. &#8220;Right now we&#8217;re still primarily in a research phase, but hosts have been very receptive and proactive in this area.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Mar 2015 19:31:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Joseph: WIRED on WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://josephscott.org/?p=11657\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://josephscott.org/archives/2015/03/wired-on-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:933:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/03/wired-dot-com-from-the-devs/\">WIRED.com has merged into one WordPress install</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nOur redesign is here thanks to a big under-the-radar project in March 2014, when we migrated 17 active WIRED blogs into a single WordPress install.

There&#8217;s definitely something fun about discussing the latest developments with other people who are also caught up, in the zeitgeist, and the anticipation of new episodes coming out, like what I imagine it must have been like with <a title=\"Some of my favorite sci-fi was actually originally published serialized.\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_%28literature%29\">serialized novels back in the day</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 01 Mar 2015 03:43:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Matt: Writing code is like solving a Rubik’s cube\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=44731\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://ma.tt/2015/02/code-cube/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"<p>Ben Dwyer on why <a href=\"https://scruffian.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/writing-code-is-like-solving-a-rubiks-cube/\">writing code is like solving a Rubik’s cube</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 04:55:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Post Status: The most popular WordPress plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=8913\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://poststatus.com/popular-wordpress-plugins/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15391:\"<p>WordPress has long had download counts for core WordPress, plugins, and themes.</p>\n<p>But downloads counts are deceiving.

There is a private beta program on WordPress.org that offers just that, and at least some of the new stats are launching <em>very, very</em> soon (<em><strong>edit</strong>: the initial changes are now live</em>).</p>\n<p>The new plugin stats pages will show four new charts, visible to plugin authors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New installs per day</li>\n<li>Updates per day</li>\n<li>Active installs per day</li>\n<li>Active versions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most importantly, the &#8220;active installs per day&#8221; chart shows us &#8212; with much greater precision than we previously had &#8212; how many actual websites are running any plugin available on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>For the beta period, utilizing a non-public query string parameter, I was able to see these stats publicly for any plugin on the repo. That query string parameter has now changed, so the data is no longer publicly visible.</p>\n<p>These stats are partially launching very shortly, to highlight the active installs for plugins as well as the breakdown of active versions. Active install counts will replace the download count in the right column.</p>\n<p>You can see an example of what the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/stats/\">public stats from the WordPress Importer plugin</a> look like, which will be visible to users.

However, beware that <em>there is not a guarantee of accuracy here</em>, and in fact you should know that in some instances, the team knows the data isn&#8217;t reporting properly, especially for plugins with more installs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote alignright\">Contact Form 7 and Akismet are by far the most popular WordPress plugins, with over six million active installs each.</span> I included most of the plugins from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/\">Popular page on the repo</a>, plus some additional notable plugins.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of outliers, where the discrepancy between downloads and active installs is huge. I believe this is largely due to plugins with long histories that were once immensely popular but have since faded in popularity.</p>\n<p>The download count keeps old plugins relevant far longer than if active installs were the prominent number.</p>\n<h3>Compared to BuiltWith data</h3>\n<p>How accurate is this data? Well, one smell-test we can give it is to compare it to other potentially inaccurate data. From my research, BuiltWith is doing one of the best jobs around of accurately checking site data. Go ahead and input your domain to BuiltWith and see how accurate it is for you.</p>\n<p>So, if we compare this same plugin list to BuiltWith data for &#8220;the entire Internet&#8221; &#8212; as they segment based on site rankings &#8212; then we can get a feel for how well the WordPress.org number and theBuiltWith number get along.</p>\n<p>In this table, I link to the BuiltWith page so you can get more information if you like. Do note that some plugins aren&#8217;t available on BuiltWith, so are in the list but don&#8217;t have information.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Plugin</th>\n<th>BuiltWith</th>\n<th>Active Installs</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Contact-Form-7\">Contact Form 7</a></td>\n<td>594,677</td>\n<td>6.3+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Akismet\">Akismet</a></td>\n<td>166,791</td>\n<td>6.2+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Yoast-WordPress-SEO-Plugin\">WordPress SEO</a></td>\n<td>2.602 million</td>\n<td>3.7+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/JetPack\">Jetpack</a></td>\n<td>1.629 million</td>\n<td>3.7+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WordPress Importer</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>3.4+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Google Sitemap Generator</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>3.4+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All In One SEO</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>3.1+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/WP-Super-Cache\">WP Super Cache</a></td>\n<td>991,729</td>\n<td>1.7+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny MCE Advanced</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>1.4+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/NextGEN-Gallery\">NextGen Gallery</a></td>\n<td>977,343</td>\n<td>1.3+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Yoast-Google-Analytics-for-WordPress\">Google Analytics for WordPress</a></td>\n<td>871,144</td>\n<td>1.2+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop/WooCommerce\">WooCommerce</a></td>\n<td>685,937</td>\n<td>1.2+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hello Dolly</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>1.1+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/WP-PageNavi\">WP Page Navi</a></td>\n<td>585,809</td>\n<td>1.1+ million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/W3-Total-Cache\">W3 Total Cache</a></td>\n<td>571,864</td>\n<td>970,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WordFence</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>710,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Better WP Security</td>\n<td>n/a</td>\n<td>600,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/cms/WPTouch-Pro\">WPTouch (Pro Data only)</a></td>\n<td>15,696</td>\n<td>410,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/bbPress\">bbPress</a></td>\n<td>126,081</td>\n<td>250,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/MailPoet\">MailPoet</a></td>\n<td>149,018</td>\n<td>230,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/The-Events-Calendar\">The Events Calendar</a></td>\n<td>56,095</td>\n<td>230,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/cms/BuddyPress\">BuddyPress</a></td>\n<td>76,853</td>\n<td>150,000+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop/WP-eCommerce\">WP eCommerce</a></td>\n<td>58,115</td>\n<td>80,000+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Data Accuracy</h3>\n<p>There are zero instances from this list where BuiltWith shows more sites than WordPress.org using a plugin. That is a confidence enhancing note, as WordPress.org should be much more fully comprehensive.</p>\n<p>There are some instances, especially with plugins that are on the backend, or have limited front-end visibility, where the numbers don&#8217;t line up too well.</p>\n<p>However, for the highly visible plugins, the WordPress.org data <em>feels</em> good to me, in comparison to BuiltWith.</p>\n<p>The team working on the new stats has less confidence in the numbers as the numbers get higher. So for plugins with well beyond a million installs, they have reason to believe adoption may be different than what is reflected in the stats.</p>\n<h3>How stats are collected</h3>\n<p>WordPress.org collects this data via the update checks that a WordPress install performs.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of caveats to consider for the WordPress.org data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The numbers could include (and therefore inflate numbers) non-public (dev and staging environments) domains. According to Andrew Nacin, the team does exclude sites with &#8220;localhost&#8221;, &#8220;.dev&#8221;, &#8220;.local&#8221; and &#8220;other telltale signs of local development and staging sites, like IP addresses.&#8221;</li>\n<li>The numbers don&#8217;t include websites that have, via code, turned off update checks.</li>\n<li>Some data is making more sense as it is collected. Now that it&#8217;s a few months old, they are able to make better determinations about what is accurate and what is not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind the percentage of installs that wouldn&#8217;t be included in these checks is minimal. Also, unfortunately, a large percentage of folks just don&#8217;t keep dev or local installs of their websites, so those numbers probably do not inflate the totals as much as you may think either &#8212; though I&#8217;m guessing on that front.</p>\n<p>For the accuracy of the numbers, the team has seen some discrepancies, where one graph shows data that should also impact another, but it does not. They&#8217;re working to resolve these issues still.</p>\n<h3>This data is important</h3>\n<p>The team working on this project has been deciding on which stats pages to showcase for the general public, and which to show to plugin authors.</p>\n<p>The active install data is important, and it needs to be public for users, in addition to plugin authors. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">If we can ensure that the data is even remotely accurate, it is far superior to using download counts alone.</span></p>\n<p>Download counts give legacy plugins too much clout in the repo, and also make misinformation all the more likely.</p>\n<p>A prime example is that of Slimstats, which had the recent security breach. That plugin has over 1.3 million downloads. But when I looked at the stats, there were only 100,000 or so active installs.</p>\n<p>Yet, when tech blogs covered the security breach of the plugin, they largely cited &#8220;over a million&#8221; installs at risk. This is bad for WordPress and it&#8217;s unnecessary. We can fix it. <em>We have the data</em>.</p>\n<p>Lead developer Dion Hulse also had this to say about the progress of the stats pages, when I notified him that I had access to these numbers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The current beta stats page was put together as a trial to find what data plugin authors wanted (We&#8217;ve been in touch with a few who have provided great feedback in the past on the stats).</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on what they have learned, they are launching the active install numbers and active version chart, and will follow up with a future launch for the plugin author only stats. The plugin author stats are going to go live with the notice that they may not be totally accurate, and they may change over time as the team continues to analyze the data.</p>\n<p>WordPress is open source, and has absolutely massive adoption across the web, as we all know. It is therefore a source for what&#8217;s become a multi-billion dollar industry. WordPress.org and those that hold the keys to the website have great power.</p>\n<p>Changes to the website and how themes, plugins, and any other potentially business-centric data make a difference to real businesses.</p>\n<p>All those businesses have signed up for this (being involved with the WordPress project), and therefore any risks associated, but in my mind this data &#8212; especially of active installs &#8212; brings welcome sunlight to a murky plugin landscape.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad I was able to see this data. I&#8217;m very pleased that the active install numbers are replacing the download counts. WordPress itself will be better for it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 02:38:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Time To Abolish Post Specific Metaboxes in The WordPress Post Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39792\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://wptavern.com/time-to-abolish-metaboxes-in-the-wordpress-post-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3615:\"<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WPMetaBoxesFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39792]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-39793\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WPMetaBoxesFeaturedImage.png?resize=640%2C300\" alt=\"WP Metabox Featured Image\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/66992990@N00/6532917427\">packing up</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used WordPress to write about WordPress for more than seven years, it&#8217;s how I make a living.

I think the feeling is stronger if you write in WordPress every day as it&#8217;s an endless cycle of filling in text areas, fields, uploading media, and clicking the publish button. Many of these tasks take place within their own metabox which is something that detracts from a seamless experience. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m ready to try something different.</p>\n<p>Many of the posts I write post consists of content blocks such as: blockquotes, media, etc. Thinking about how I create content in WordPress, the conceptual post editor <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/\">proposed in 2013</a> makes complete sense. Instead of a full-blown TinyMCE editor, I could select from a set of established content blocks. In addition to the content block idea, some of the metaboxes are integrated into the editor.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ContentEditingProposal.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39792]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8380\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ContentEditingProposal.png?resize=1025%2C825\" alt=\"ContentEditingProposal\" /></a>Proposal To Revamp The Post Writing/Editing Interface\n<p>The publish, categories, and tags metaboxes are integrated into the editor. It probably wouldn&#8217;t take too much effort to add a way to feature an image. I don&#8217;t know how usable this interface is, but I&#8217;d love to give it a try for a few months. The more metaboxes that disappear, the less I feel like I&#8217;m hitting switches and turning knobs before clicking the publish button. By having some of these tasks integrated into the editor, I think it&#8217;ll provide a better publishing experience.</p>\n<p>I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to get rid of all the metaboxes because of the plugins I use. However, I&#8217;m most interested in an interface that consists of less scrolling, searching, etc., that gets me to the publishing stage quicker without feeling like a data entry specialist.</p>\n<p>Despite a large amount of discussion surrounding the proposal, the <a title=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2013/08/08/proposal-improving-the-content-editing-experience/\">concept lost steam</a>. Although I&#8217;ve never used it, I feel like I&#8217;d prefer it over the current editor. It&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess if we&#8217;ll ever see the post editor undergo a major change, but if it did, this is the direction I&#8217;d like to see it go.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 02:28:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: SIDEKICK Adds Support For WordPress Multisite, Launches Partnership With MediaTemple\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39720\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://wptavern.com/sidekick-adds-support-for-wordpress-multisite-launches-partnership-with-mediatemple\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6344:\"<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SIDEKICKFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39720]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-37436\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SIDEKICKFeaturedImage.png?resize=769%2C227\" alt=\"SIDEKICKFeaturedImage\" /></a></p>\n<p>SIDEKICK has <a title=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/multisite-genesis-media-temple-oh-my/\" href=\"http://www.sidekick.pro/blog/multisite-genesis-media-temple-oh-my/\">announced</a> that its voice-guided <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sidekick/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sidekick/\">WordPress </a><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sidekick/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sidekick/\">training</a><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sidekick/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sidekick/\"> video plugin</a> now supports WordPress Multisite. According to SIDEKICK Co-founder, Ben Fox, WordPress Multisite has been one of the most requested features from users. Users can now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easily auto activate your SIDEKICK license across all sites on your network</li>\n<li>Set a Walkthrough to auto-start the first time a new user logs into any site on your network</li>\n<li>Enable and disable walkthroughs and walkthrough categories network wide from one screen</li>\n</ol>\n<p>SIDEKICK has a <a title=\"http://support.sidekick.pro/article/101-sidekick-for-wordpress-multisite\" href=\"http://support.sidekick.pro/article/101-sidekick-for-wordpress-multisite\">support article</a> that goes into more detail on how to activate Multisite.</p>\n<h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>\n<p>SIDEKICK&#8217;s Chief of Technology and Product Development, Bart Dabek, describes the most challenging aspect they encountered adding Multisite support, &#8220;The biggest challenge was incorporating our API and building out the relationship between the super admin setup page and individual sites. Once that relationship was established, it was easy to pull in settings from the network settings and assign them to individual sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some things to keep in mind with our particular situation is, keeping authentication details within the super admin account so that if our sessions expire, the system can automatically log back into our API and continue to auto activate SIDEKICK on new sites without the need for the super admin to do anything. It&#8217;s something developers will have to consider if they&#8217;re dealing with an API on this level,&#8221; Dabek said.</p>\n<h2>Free Genesis Walkthroughs</h2>\n<p>If you use SIDEKICK with the Genesis Framework by <a title=\"http://www.studiopress.com/\" href=\"http://www.studiopress.com/\">StudioPress</a>, you&#8217;ll see 30 free Genesis walkthroughs.

Faster browsing and filtering means users can more easily sort through the thousands of available options. While the directory includes many beautiful, high quality themes, it often requires sifting through hundreds to find that diamond in the rough.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons for the glut of lackluster and uninspired new theme submissions is a lack of design feedback from the Theme Review team. Reviews have traditionally focused primarily on the code quality of themes and often neglect major design issues with new submissions.</p>\n<p>During the team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/02/27/this-weeks-a-little-late-meeting-notes-we/\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> this week, contributors discussed ways to encourage more design feedback on submissions to the directory. WordPress.org theme author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryelle\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Dwan</a> broached the topic in a recent <a href=\"https://redradar.net/2015/02/23/1612/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> about ways to get designers involved during the review process:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we tell people that they don’t need to be expert developers to review themes, and that this is a good way to learn better coding practices, why don’t we do the same with design? Good design is just as subjective as code standards (in that the basics aren&#8217;t, but people like to argue about it anyway).</p>\n<p>The quality of code in the theme repo is improved by the review process, so we should encourage design reviews to increase the quality of design, too.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Her post included practical suggestions for updating the theme review handbook to provide better guidance on how to offer design feedback. This is one way that designers can contribute on WordPress.org, even if they&#8217;re not comfortable helping with the code review aspect of the process.</p>\n<h3>New Design Recommendation Added to the Handbook</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/melchoyce\" target=\"_blank\">Mel Choyce</a>, Design Engineer at Automattic, volunteered to start filling out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/recommended/design/\" target=\"_blank\">design section of the Theme Review Handbook</a> with recommendations. &#8220;Theme authors are never exposed to design guidelines before uploading their themes, unlike code guidelines,&#8221; she said. This is something the team is currently working to change.</p>\n<p>The design recommendations so far are formatted to help the theme author think more critically about design decisions. Instead of taking a hard line about subjective aspects of design, the recommendations invite the designer to consider the theme from a user&#8217;s perspective. A few examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you tell if the theme has an ideal audience in mind?</li>\n<li>Is the type large enough to comfortably read?</li>\n<li>Body text should generally be 14px or larger on desktop, unless using a font with a generous x-height.</li>\n<li>Are the header and body fonts easy to read?</li>\n<li>Is there enough difference between headers and paragraphs to distinguish them from each other?</li>\n<li>Do paragraphs have enough line-height? If you squint your eyes, can you still see some space between lines?</li>\n<li>A good rule of thumb is 1.3-1.4 on headers, and 1.4-1.6 on body text.</li>\n<li>Is the color contrast high enough?

Now, whether you&#8217;re behind the wheel of your WordPress site in the admin, or browsing on the official directory, the experience of searching and sorting themes is more consistent.</p>\n<p>Konstantin Obenland, in cooperation with Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, spearheaded the migration to the new plugin and design, with help and feedback from other members of the meta team. The work is not yet complete, but the new directory provides a vastly improved experience for users on the hunt for a new theme. Searching and filtering are both faster and users can quickly browse through thumbnails of all the queried results via infinite scroll.</p>\n<p>Future internationalization improvements to the directory should make it an even better resource for WordPress&#8217; growing global audience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is still a lot more work to be done, but everything that’s remaining can be added, changed, or improved with the new directory active,&#8221; Obenland said in an update earlier this week. <strong>&#8220;Most importantly we want to make it available to language sites, so that we have an internationalized theme directory, and there will be more to be done around that.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>The improved browsing experience does a much better job of showcasing the work of theme authors, many of whom spend countless hours updating and supporting their free themes as a contribution to the WordPress community. Overall, the new design is a better representation of the high quality themes available in the official directory.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 01:58:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: Add Infinite Scroll to the WordPress Admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=39320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://wptavern.com/add-infinite-scroll-to-the-wordpress-admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3059:\"<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/infinite.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[39320]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/infinite.jpg?resize=1024%2C508\" alt=\"photo credit: தேவையில்லை காரணங்கள், நீ எங்கே? - (license)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-39685\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25066200@N02/8659691170\">தேவையில்லை காரணங்கள், நீ எங்கே?</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>The WordPress admin list tables can get quite lengthy to browse if you&#8217;re relying on regular pagination, especially when you need to perform bulk actions.</p>\n<p>As of WordPress 4.0, the grid view of the media library has beautiful support for infinite scrolling, but list tables for posts and users still rely on old-fashioned pagination.

As far as I&#8217;ve seen, no tickets currently exist on trac to propose infinite scroll for other areas of the admin.

Unless you&#8217;re running on recommendations or personal experience, it may not be easy to narrow down a quality plugin that keeps pace with changes to the Twitter API.</p>\n<p>This week Twitter finally decided to <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/web/wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">release an official WordPress plugin</a> to assist users in optimizing their sites for a Twitter audience. I spoke with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/niall\" target=\"_blank\">Niall Kennedy</a>, Developer Advocate at Twitter and contributor on its official WordPress plugin, about Twitter&#8217;s plans for the plugin. Kennedy is also listed as a contributor on both the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/vine/\" target=\"_blank\">Vine</a> plugins for WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Twitter regularly works with partners to implement Twitter features on their site,&#8221; Kennedy said. <strong>&#8220;Shipping an official plugin allows us to directly support publishers powered by WordPress and provide an example implementation of Twitter best practices for publishers on any platform.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>The plugin requires PHP 5.4 or later and offers many features that you many have already seen available via other extensions, including customization of embedded tweets, embedded Twitter videos, Tweet button for sharing content, Twitter Cards, integration with Twitter Analytics, a Follow button, and ads conversion tracking.</p>\n<p>Many are wondering why anyone needs an official Twitter plugin, given that WordPress already has excellent oEmbed support for tweets.  Kennedy confirmed that the new plugin plays nicely with the built-in oEmbed support, while building on top of it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Twitter plugin for WordPress enhances the oEmbed support built-in to WordPress with additional customization and functionality. We enhance the typical oEmbed response with additional integrations with WordPress APIs.</p>\n<p>Our plugin loads Twitter&#8217;s widgets JavaScript asynchronously through <code>wp_enqueue_script</code>, omitting the script element typically inserted onto the page markup through the default oEmbed response.</p>\n<p>Each embedded Tweet, added through a URL or shortcode, passes through the shortcode&#8217;s filter (<code>shortcode_atts_tweet</code>) for customization of embedded Tweet features across the site. The plugin handles fetching the correct oEmbed markup from Twitter&#8217;s servers and caching the unique result for the customization.</p>\n<p>The plugin does not change MCE oEmbed handling in the admin view.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kennedy declined to comment on why it took Twitter so long to release an official plugin, but hopes that WordPress developers will use it as a building block. Those who previously created Twitter plugins now have a solid example for how best to extend WordPress to customize Twitter&#8217;s latest features.</p>\n<h3>Designed to be Extensibile</h3>\n<p>The development team behind the plugin plans to add new features to it as they become available from Twitter. They recognize that it will not be realistic to offer every imaginable feature, but instead are prioritizing extensibility to make sure developers can easily create their own customizations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin includes <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-video\" target=\"_blank\">support for displaying Twitter-hosted video embeds</a>, a new feature available to Twitter developers just in the past few weeks,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;An official Twitter plugin makes it easy to roll out new features to publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">We&#8217;re working with other plugin developers to integrate features through filters where any overlap may occur</span>,&#8221; he said. Kennedy has a few ideas for the kinds of integrations that developers might want to build for the plugin using the WordPress APIs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our plugin automatically generates Twitter Card markup to represent a post, making some best guesses for post formats built-in to Core,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We expect plugin developers creating more specific display experiences will be able to build on top of our base features to select the best Twitter Cards template for their content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kennedy also believes the plugin can be further extended by SEO plugins to optimize content. &#8220;Some of the most popular WordPress plugins involve SEO,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would like to integrate with SEO plugins to highlight the best titles, descriptions, and other detailed data provided by publishers to help their content stand out on Twitter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Additionally, he sees an opportunity for theme developers to make tweets a seamless part of a theme&#8217;s overall design. &#8220;Our embedded Tweet theming can be customized by theme authors to match the visual theme of their site,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Automatically adjusting Twitter theming components to a WordPress theme context would be pretty cool.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to add the most common Twitter features to your WordPress site, you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a better plugin than the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">official one on WordPress.org</a>. Kennedy confirmed that Twitter plans to support the plugin through its official support forums on WordPress.org and will also have an escalated support channel for managed hosting providers.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 20:10:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 181 – Sticky Posts and Legal Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://wptavern.com?p=39625&preview_id=39625\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-181-sticky-posts-and-legal-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3804:\"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a title=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\" href=\"http://marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I take the opportunity to catch up on the latest news in the WordPress community.

Last but not least, we run down a list of upcoming WordCamps.</p>\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n<p><a title=\"http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/do-you-use-the-sticky-posts-feature-in-wordpress\">Do You Use The Sticky Posts Feature in WordPress?</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/content-protection-plugins-for-wordpress-do-more-harm-than-good\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/content-protection-plugins-for-wordpress-do-more-harm-than-good\">Content Protection Plugins for WordPress Do More Harm Than Good</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/press-this-bookmarklet-generates-concerns-of-copyright-infringement\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/press-this-bookmarklet-generates-concerns-of-copyright-infringement\">Press This Bookmarklet Generates Concerns of Copyright Infringement</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-4-8-released-adds-visual-editor\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-4-8-released-adds-visual-editor\">WordPress for iOS 4.8 Released, Adds Visual Editor</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/high-risk-security-vulnerability-discovered-in-wp-slimstat-update-immediately\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/high-risk-security-vulnerability-discovered-in-wp-slimstat-update-immediately\">High Risk Security Vulnerability Discovered in WP Slimstat, Update Immediately</a><br />\n<a title=\"https://poststatus.com/twitter-official-plugin-for-wordpress/\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/twitter-official-plugin-for-wordpress/\">Twitter Releases Official WordPress Plugin</a><br />\n<a title=\"https://story.am/\" href=\"https://story.am/\">Story.am Launches to Founders</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\" href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">Upcoming WordCamps Schedule</a></p>\n<h2>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h2>\n<p><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-role-based-price/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-role-based-price/\">Woo Commerce Role Based Price</a> extends the popular eCommerce plugin Woo Commerce, so that products can be offered at different prices for different customer groups.</p>\n<p><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-code-editor/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-code-editor/\">Better Code Editor</a> adds line numbers, error detection, and a choice of 28 different themes to use in the Plugin and Theme editors.</p>\n<p><a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wprecovery/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wprecovery/\">WPRecovery</a> is a WordPress recovery manager, that will get your WordPress Site back up and running if it stops working correctly.</p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, March 4th 9:30 P.M.

That&#8217;s because the ratings system has been reset and rebuilt by Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood. The ratings now correspond exactly with reviews. According to Wood, the change has been two and a half years in the making:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back when we launched the review system 2.5 years ago, we tied ratings to reviews. However, up until that point, we had existing ratings in the system. At the time, some argued that the ratings should be wiped out and everybody start fresh. I argued for the opposite, that we should leave the existing ratings in place until such time as we had enough reviews in the system to build up a good body of ratings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A few weeks ago, Wood was checking out the ratings for the new WordPress theme directory when he noticed there were over 150K reviews. &#8220;Out of those 150K reviews, less than 10K are for themes&#8221; Wood said. This was enough to initiate the change and remove ratings not attached to a review. Since the system was rebuilt, some plugins have experienced 1 and 5 star <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/star-rating-of-our-plugin-has-changed-overnight-1-star-and-5-star-look-switched?replies=2&view=all#post-6614288\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/star-rating-of-our-plugin-has-changed-overnight-1-star-and-5-star-look-switched?replies=2&view=all#post-6614288\">rating swings,</a> while plugins like <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/\">WP eCommerce</a> have seen its average rating rise from 2.9 to 3.4 stars.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>That means <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpecommerce\">@wpecommerce</a>, which had been at a rating of 2.8 for years, and more recently 2.9 &#8211; is now 3.4 stars.&#10;&#10;That feels good :)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Justin Sainton (@JS_Zao) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JS_Zao/status/570739795405750272\">February 26, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to displaying more accurate data, review spam has been neutralized. Review spam has been a serious problem for the past several years. According to Otto, this is no longer the case:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ask any of the moderation team how many duplicate accounts they&#8217;ve seen to vote up their plugin and down those of competitors. Even though the reviews were removed, until yesterday, the ratings made by those accounts remained. This is no longer the case, and the ratings made by those spam accounts has now been effectively neutralized.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In summary, ratings and averages now reflect the most accurate data from the point in time reviews were introduced. Spam and fraudulent data hasn&#8217;t been lost or deleted but rather ignored from influencing the data set. Ratings that were added before mandatory reviews are also ignored.</p>\n<p>By waiting two and a half years, Wood has avoided resetting the entire system which would have caused everyone to start from zero. This way, authors are able to maintain their ratings and reviews without starting from scratch. If you host a plugin on the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugin directory</a>, let us know if your ratings changed, especially the average.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 06:39:42

If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire price of all bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction price with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were priced at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013. If Bitcoin could grab even 1% of the market, then the price will should go up much higher than it is.\r\n\r\nFor large organizations or individuals that want to trade a billion or more dollars worth of bitcoins, then they would either have to buy about a quarter of all bitcoins in circulation at the current rate. If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.\r\n\r\nWith the liquidity of bitcoins and the continued mining, I\'m not sure it is going to skyrocket too high. Most companies just sell the bitcoins as soon as they receive them. Maybe that will change if the price keeps going up, but it is too much of a gamble for a large company to hold onto the bitcoins unless if they have plenty of cash reserves to cover the potential drop in the price of bitcoins. I think the cost to mine will stay aligned with the price because why would someone pay more for bitcoins when they can pay less to mine them and the other way around, so the two should stay pretty close together. And, there is only so much hashing power being created every month so the price could surge more in the short while hashing power surges will be more long-term.\r\n\r\nAnd, the blockchain tech is really about proof of existence - a hash of a document can be stored on the blockchain to prove that it existed at a certain time. The more valuable the documents that get put on the blockchain, then the hashing needs to be greater to ensure that they are secure and that will bring up the price. I don\'t see it happening that quickly, but I might be very wrong. A huge surge of newcomers coming in could increase the demand so much higher than the supply, that the price will have no choice but to go up. Mining hardware would be out of stock if that happened since it would technically be cheaper to mine it than to buy it. It will be an interesting ride watching all the variables interacting with each other.','What a bitcoin Can Be Priced At?','','publish','open','open','','what-can-bitcoins-be-valued-at','','','2015-01-26 01:53:48','2015-01-26 01:53:48','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9',0,'post','',0),(10,1,'2015-01-19 18:12:57','2015-01-19 18:12:57','The value of bitcoins could fall to a low level if there are not a lot of people that used it and they only used it for small transactions.

If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.','What Can Bitcoins Be Valued At','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2015-01-19 18:12:57','2015-01-19 18:12:57','',9,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=10',0,'revision','',0),(11,1,'2015-01-19 18:29:36','2015-01-19 18:29:36','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8473648-boss-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8473648-boss-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Boss\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBy no means can Bitcoin be labeled as a Ponzi scheme.

It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy in order to sustain the market so price don\'t rapidly decline. Bitcoin mining is inflation. This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half. \r\n\r\nThe number of miners is growing at a rapid pace. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it constantly growing over time so every week it reaches another all time high. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. The value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. That might be partly a reason for the declines in 2014. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. Currently, you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go about 25% down from the going rate. There are fewer sell orders until about 50% above going rate. So, more people are ready to buy then there are to sell as of the writing of this article. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate. This computing power will be directly proportional to the going rate. Over the long run, you can see that both the computer power and price have steadily grown since 2009.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. \r\n\r\nCurrently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them unless if they owned a significant amount of bitcoins or had stake in a 3rd party Bitcoin app. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed since it is a transfer of wealth and power. \r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. \r\n\r\nBitcoin can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-commentary','','','2015-01-26 01:50:06','2015-01-26 01:50:06','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=17',0,'post','',0),(18,1,'2015-01-19 19:03:37','2015-01-19 19:03:37','I think the price of bitcoin is going to be hovering around the cost to mine a bitcoin for a while, but it will see some spikes and drops.

It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy in order to sustain the market so price don\'t rapidly decline. Bitcoin mining is inflation. This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half. \n\nThe number of miners is growing at a rapid pace. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it constantly growing over time so every week it reaches another all time high. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. The value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. That might be partly a reason for the declines in 2014. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. Currently, you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go about 25% down from the going rate. There are fewer sell orders until about 50% above going rate. So, more people are ready to buy then there are to sell as of the writing of this article. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate. This computing power will be directly proportional to the going rate. Over the long\n\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. Currently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them unless if they owned a significant amount of bitcoins or had stake in a 3rd party Bitcoin app. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed since it is a transfer of wealth and power. There are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. It can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit.

The way that it is done is that a hash of a document gets stored at an address on the Block Chain. The hash and date is now stored on the Block Chain for all of eternity. A document could then be verified to have existed on the Block Chain at a future date. This would be good for copyright, wills, deeds, and similar. This would be similar to getting a document notarized. It will have a signature stating that the document existed at a certain date. Courts and other legal entities only accept notarized documents from a certified notary. It would be much easier and cheaper to get a document notarized on the Block Chain. It could then be sent over the internet without creating a printed out copy. That would be excellent for the environment since using electricity and computers is more efficient than paper. Think about how much effort is done to bring paper documents across the country. You could argue that an e-mail is also proof of existence. However, an e-mail is harder to verify and make publicly available. It is certainly not as secure of a method as using the Block Chain. E-mails can be erased from existence fairly easily. A transaction on the Block Chain will never be erased.\r\n\r\nHow would using the Block Chain for this affect the price of a bitcoin? I would argue that the more valuable the Block Chain is, the more secure it would become. And, the more secure that it would become, then everything that the Block Chain is used for that is useful would become more valuable. Miners secure the network and receive bitcoin as a reward. If bitcoins are not valuable, miners will not secure the network. The more valuable bitcoins and the Bitcoin network is, then the higher the price of a bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAny parties that have an interest in the Block Chain or bitcoins or any technology that utilizes Bitoin will have vested much and would support the system - they would not let it fail. If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will attempt to do that in order to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The Block Chain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for encrypted data to be sent over an un-encrypted network. \r\n\r\nBitcoin is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s. If someone can have an immutable proof of existence that the whole world can verify, that is huge! Using the Block Chain for this very task is extremely convenient!  I don\'t think Bitcoin or Block Chain will ever go away - it will exist as a historical artifact even after we stop using it. By the time it is obsolete, the human race will have at least inhabited several galaxies. Even then, it may still be useful. It may be one of the longest running and widely used currency, but we can\'t say for certainty just yet. We will have to wait and find out. I would recommend buying a few bitcoins just in case if Bitcoin and the Block Chain take off.','Proof of Existence','','publish','open','open','','proof-of-existence','','','2015-01-26 02:13:51','2015-01-26 02:13:51','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=21',0,'post','',0),(22,1,'2015-01-19 19:15:47','2015-01-19 19:15:47','The blockchain can be used to prove that a document existed at a certain date.

If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire value of bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction value with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were valued at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013. If Bitcoin could grab even 1% of the market, then the price will should go up much higher than it is.\r\n\r\nFor large organizations or individuals that want to trade a billion or more dollars worth of bitcoins, then they would either have to buy about a quarter of all bitcoins in circulation at the current rate. If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.','What Can Bitcoins Be Valued At','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2015-01-19 19:20:52','2015-01-19 19:20:52','',9,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=23',0,'revision','',0),(24,1,'2015-01-19 19:29:40','2015-01-19 19:29:40','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics1.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 30px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics1.gif\" alt=\"bitcoindynamics\" width=\"192\" height=\"380\" /></a>\r\nAmplification</b>\r\n\r\nA group of coordinated wealthy individuals or businesses could have a large impact on the market. The way the buys and sells are setup is that people make a bid to buy or sell a certain number of bitcoin at a certain price. There are only so many bitcoins listed on the market. If someone wanted to buy 10,000 bitcoins, then they would not be able to buy that many at the current market rates. There might only be 100 listed within +1% of current price, 1000 withing +5% of current price and 10,000 within +20% of current price. \r\n\r\nIf they wanted 10,000 bitcoins, then they would have to buy some of those bitcoin from sellers that list their price at higher than the current market rate. This would in turn bring the rate up. A single exchange might not be able to handle that many bitcoins without the price skyrocketing to +100% of current market rate. The wealthy individual would be better off buying 1,000 bitcoins from each of the major exchanges. They would need to buy a percentage of these bitcoins each day over a longer period of time in order to not cause a spike in the price. However, they would risk that the price goes into a temporary bubble or a longer term increase in price and they would end up paying more for the bitcoins then they would have if they just bought 10,000 outright. The market is extremely volatile! There would need to be a carefully planned entry into the market for these individuals to get a maximum amount of bitcoin for the most minimal price possible. There would be no perfect solution for this. It is a gamble on the unknown of the market.\r\n\r\n<b>High Prices</b>\r\n\r\nThe high price of bitcoins are making it so average people will not buy or use Bitcoin. The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. The actual price is irrelevant to their use since it is interchangeable with the USD. There are currently only 13.8 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million. There are 8 digits on the left of the dot and 8 digits on the right: \"13,800,000.12345678\". There is plenty of divisibility here. The high prices have a psychological effect on people in both directions - some people like the fact that the price of a single bitcoin is higher rather than there being 13 trillion bitcoins and there only ever being 21 trillion bitcoin. If the dot was shifted to the left 6 places like this 13,800,000,000,000.12 then, it would be fundamentally the same. Some people would prefer this for purely psychological reason.\r\n\r\nOnce more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase. Once the value of the market increases, bitcoins will have a higher price tag. The price will find an equilibrium between this and an uncountable (maybe countable) number of other factors. The price to mine a bitcoin will be factored into the price. Why would someone pay $400 for a bitcoin when they can mine one for $300 or less? The price to mine a bitcoin has been decreasing. This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine. The halving of the block reward that is predicted for around 2016 will make for a price increase of a possible factor of 2. \r\n\r\nMoore’s law suggests that computing power on a processor doubles every two years. For the ASICs that mine bitcoin, they have doubled every 6 months. This has huge implications in of itself! This will make it cheaper and cheaper to mine bitcoin. However, if the demand for bitcoins increases to a number larger than what the miners are generating and selling, then current bitcoin holders will sell their holding or the price will rise significantly. Buyers will have to be willing to spend the higher amount of cash for a bitcoin or wait for someone to sell at a lower price. That might not ever happen. Some people depend on selling their bitcoins to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to sell - they are forced to sell at low prices. All of these factors will make for a natural & free market. There could be short-lived crashes and bubbles, but I think the price will stay at around the price of mining with the supply &amp; demand factored into some complex equation.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot Commodity</b>\r\n\r\nPeople will want to get into Bitcoin.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. This process of halving continues until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. However, there is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market. Learn more about the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">Costs of Bitcoin</a> paid through inflation and transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9\">price of a bitcoin</a>. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. This is about a half a watt of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially. I would not be surprised to see rates of 0.01 W/GH/s in a few years from now. Moore\'s law states that processing power doubles every 18 months - the processing power for ASIC miners for Bitcoin doubles every 6 months. This time for doubling is shrinking. We could see doubling of processing power every month at some point in the future. Most people predicted that Moore\'s law would slow down, but this might not be the case. However, there are some physical limitations in our universe that will prevent us from further increasing processing power. I would say the most extreme limitation is the speed of light.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? It does create the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing surrounding Bitcoin mining. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi-attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there during the winter months. I use it as my little hobby/work room and the miners now provide, basically, free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoins until they, hopefully, reach much higher prices. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. I did buy them with a credit card on a 0% APR promotion so I would not have been able to purchase the bitcoins directly with my credit card as I can with the mining hardware. I will also be able to, hopefully, sell the miners in May when the warm weather approaches. This makes mining profitable for my specific case. \r\n\r\nTypically, the only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining & Exchanges</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can potentially make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that Moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years.\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahash, exahash, zettahash or yottahash. Those are real words, too! petahash means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahash means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. \r\n\r\nThe mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. \r\n\r\nDuring price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 15,000 times higher than the world\'s 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn\'t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. \r\n\r\nHowever, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of nations to protect its\' citizens assets and interests. Citizens from many nations have vested interest in Bitcoin. An attack on the Bitcoin network by individuals will be regarded as an act of terrorism against all the countries who have citizens that are vested in Bitcoin. Nations would be obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. If a nation attacked the Bitcoin network, it will be viewed as an act of cyber-warfare against many nations at once. People argue that the Bitcoin can\'t be legitimate because there is no nation that backs it. However, there are many nations that back it. It already has more backing by more nations than any other currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 15,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. I know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 10 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-19 19:42:01','2015-01-19 19:42:01','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=28',0,'revision','',0),(29,1,'2015-01-19 19:46:54','2015-01-19 19:46:54','<b>Mining Rewards</b>\r\n\r\nCurrently, miners are getting a reward for mining. This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime in 2017. This keeps getting cut in half every four years until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. There is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out how much a bitcoin is worth. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahertz in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable.

The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? But, it creates the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will.

Note that moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years. Since the ASICs for bitcoin mining came into existence over the past couple of years, the computational power for the bitcoin mining computers has doubled every 6 months and it appears as though this doubling every 6 months will continue here on forward.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining Exchange</b>\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware.

Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use it to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain backwards and forward. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. They could track down a network of criminals &amp; terrorists.\r\n\r\nI’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this as an excuse to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have to compete besides lowering their rates for their services. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams - very large salaries &amp; bonuses depend on it! If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well ban airplanes since terrorists use them to crash into buildings. If a government bans Bitcoin with that logic, then they ought to start making it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to commit terrorism. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. These related arguments against Bitcoin does not hold up if using reasonable logic.\r\n\r\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\r\n\r\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins were created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. The anonymity is that the addresses are not associated to anybody. Once the addresses are associated to individuals, then their is no anonymity. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nOnce a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person could possibly be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. It is possible that the bitcoins were legally obtained. It would be wise to keep detailed documentation if you are planning on doing a lot of business with bitcoins. Personally, I would recommend to only purchase bitcoins from a reputable source. If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government.\r\n\r\n<strong>Court Orders</strong>\r\n\r\nA court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\r\n\r\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized?

Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use to to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people. Bitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. I’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have besides lowering their rates. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams. If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well make it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to hurt people. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. The argument does not hold up.\r\n\r\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\r\n\r\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins was created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy. Once a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person can be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. I would recommend to only purchase bitcoins from a reputable source. If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government. A court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\r\n\r\n<b>Court Orders</b>\r\n\r\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities.

If a community of servers could solve problems like search, social networks, shopping, almost any human to human interaction that we do with a computer. There could be nodes like “miners” in Bitcoin that would contain the correct answers for user queries. The network could intelligently organize any information and reward the organizers. An open source catalog could contain a valid list of the cheapest products that anybody could purchase. All of the computers would work together to locate the best available products for the lowest price. The network could connect commerce with consumers and cut out the costs of large third parties. The nodes that manage the network would be rewarded with commissions if they behave well. If they try to mess up the results, the rest of the network would find out and cut them out for new traffic immediately. This would be a decentralization of the network. Peer-to-peer networks work great for content sharing and currency, why isn\'t it used for other popular online activities?<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Web 3.0</b>\r\n\r\nIt is the internationalization of the web. People of any language will be able to communicate financially as well as through text and audio/video. You will have a store of wealth online that can easily be transferred to others at your whim. You will be free from corporations and governments limiting your freedoms. It will allow computing resources to be used just like a currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Online Activities Have Too Many Fees</b>\r\n\r\nAn open and distributed network of e-books can be created to allow for publishers to connect directly with their readers. There is no need for corporations to have a monopoly on the system and take huge cuts. Some of the cuts that they take go to pay the banks the fees for their transactions. Bitcoin takes the banks out of the transactions between merchants and consumers. This model of centralized businesses is taking too much of the money away from the the merchants and consumers. The same principle can be applied to advertisements, e-commerce and search engines.\r\n\r\n<b>Post E-Finance</b>\r\n\r\nWhat happens after technology takes over finance? Is the next sight on politics? Will computers handle international laws just as they are starting to handle international financial transactions? There might be an autonomous system where there are an agreed upon set of laws. The system will be able to monitor all people and enforce the laws. There will be no single person or groups of people that can go around the the international laws. As scary as it sounds, this might be a good thing. The system would be much more efficient than the current system since there are so many loopholes and contradictions in laws across borders.\r\n\r\nWill there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what it is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than the current services if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\r\n\r\n<b>Alt-coins</b>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it. Bitcoin is already \"the\" digital currency and it would be difficult for an alternative to surpass it.\r\n\r\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\r\n\r\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be possible. However, the heat giving off from mining could be a valuable resource. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\r\n\r\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\r\n\r\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits.

Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth.

A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to upvote it and downvote it. The more upvotes, the more bitcoin the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoin back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population. If it gets all downvotes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam. I think those articles could be spotted by requiring at least a few people see it and they could have a power attribute to the votes. Maybe they could upvote by +1, +2 and +3 and downvote -1, -2, -3. Voters could be shown some guidelines to not downvote a controversial issue. Sometimes a large percentage of the population has bad feelings towards some issues that were illegal or immoral that might now be regarded as legal and moral. Some of the bitcoin generated from the bad content could also be given to the customers that view the content. This could be done with money but the fees might be too high for content creators to put up a deposit. A content creator might only want to <i>and need to</i> put up $0.25 for their content. That would be impossible to do with a credit card. Amateurs might spend years attempting to create good content and want to try to publish it, but they don’t have money to pay for advertising. Google is good for organizing content so that people can find it, but they typically favor the same large media outlets. They also place a lot of advertisements that would avert users away from finding their content. This would also entice advertisers to produce better content and pay the users for finding it. That money currently goes to Google and there is a ton of it going there. That money could stay between the merchants and the customers. All of the money that gets paid to Google would remain in the pockets of the merchants and the customers. This system would also hurt entities that attempted to make bad content because they would have to fork over all their bitcoin to the customers and merchants. Add that to all the money that the merchants and customers save from having to “pay” for advertisements. Both the merchants and the customers pay for those advertisements because the merchant relies on the advertisement to reach the customer. The merchant then has to raise the price of the product to make a profit. The customer pays the increased fee. When you shop at shopping sites, the shopping site takes in a large amount of profits from their merchants and customers. A new system could be created that cut them out and give those profits directly to the merchants and customers. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks. There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the most efficient 3rd parties.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nA third-party could use Bitcoin to create digital wallets. One user could create and store the first half of the password and the other user could create and store the second half of the password. This could help parties come into an agreement without as much risk. If one party does not honor their commitments, then the funds are stuck in the wallet forever. This could entice both sides of the parties to honor their agreements.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that.

The big miners would own a lot of the new coins and people with money could buy them. There would be no little guys. I don\'t think any of the alt-coins out right now are going to surpass Bitcoin. There are some interesting alt-coins where the processing is used to solve useful mathematical equations. A currency like Primecoin might get larger since the hashing algorithm also looks for prime numbers and those prime numbers are useful for scientist and engineers.\r\n\r\nA new system could not be based on pure randomness for each wallet because whoever has the most wallets would get the most coins. It will end up being a race for whoever has the most computing power because the person with the most computing power could create the most wallets. Bitcoin has a good lead on any new crypto-currency since it has had so much time to mature. Currently, the newcomers with the most hashing power will earn the biggest rewards. If a similar system came out now, then the few major miners would take a majority of the mining reward. It would be a monopoly on the system. It is good that there were some little guys that got in at the beginning of Bitcoin. It is still the beginning of Bitcoin, so there is plenty of room for late stage newcomers.\r\n\r\n<b>Proof of Work</b>\r\n\r\nProof of Work is the hashing that a miner does to show that a large investment was made to verify the transactions. It is a difficult math problem that needs to be solved by an ASIC. The rest of the nodes then validate the miners work. This is necessary because if there was no proof of work, then there would be bad nodes that would try to manipulate the system. This ensures that there will be no bad actors because it would be expensive to attempt and difficult to achieve. It is easy to verify that a miner did the correct work.\r\n\r\nHere is an alternative proof of work that might be effective: a node gains power through validating &amp; processing transactions. The more correct transactions that the node has  verified, the more power it has on the network. As soon as a powerful node is caught making an incorrect transaction, then they would lose power. The network would also correct the inaccurate transaction that the bad node might have attempted to change. The transactions would have to have a maximum of a single unit. This system is feasible and it is not so expensive to operate. If a system like this could verify transactions as Bitcoin does, then Bitcoin could be in trouble since it will take far less computing power. As there are more transactions on Bitcoin, an adaption to the protocol could be made to allow for miners to spend more computing power on validating and processing transactions instead of just hashing to prove they are doing work.\r\n\r\nBitcoin would be an ancestor system to any new ones. I think it will always be around. If a new methodology arises then Bitcoin could be adapted to follow it.\r\n\r\n<b>Unfair</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of people argue that it is unfair that the ownership of all the bitcoins is skewed towards such a small number of people. The miners that provided just a small amount of computing power at the beginning and held onto their bitcoins will have made an extremely large amount of money from a network that other miners are supporting. With the growing computing power that is needed, a newcomer has to provide thousands and thousands of times more hashing than the very first miners back in 2009-2012. With the maturity of bitcoin compared to any other crypto-currency, it would be hard to make another more fair currency. Whoever gets in on the next currency first will have more coins. If the algorithm was designed to not reward so many coins at the beginning, then that would make it more fair for people that come in later. With the price lowering as of early 2015, this should force some of the early adopters to sell some of their bitcoins to others that are interested in joining the market. However, the earliest adopters built the system. It wouldn\'t be here if it wasn\'t for them. Maybe they deserve the rewards.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, there will be some early adopters that might join the status of billionaire (USD). Currently, there are 1,645 billionaires in the world. There were 268 newcomers in 2014. There is plenty of room for a few more of them. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has over 1 million bitcoins. When the price of bitcoin surged to over $1,100, Satoshi’s worth was valued over $1 Billion. However, if he tried to sell them all for $1,1000 each or any price, the demand would fall and the price of the bitcoin would fall with it probably right down to $20. I don’t think bitcoin is going to shift the wealth of the world very much. Those early adopters would be better off slowly selling bitcoins over the years. If they sell too many, the price will plummet. If they hold onto them, the price should rise, but it will be lowered once they start to sell them. They will need to sell some of them to live a billionaire lifestyle. - not everybody accepts bitcoin as a payment. Even if they do accept bitcoin as a payment, then the bitcoin will be distributed more. Wealthy people will get their hands on their share of the bitcoin. They have the power to manipulate the bitcoin markets and get it from the early adopters for cheaper than what it will be worth in the future. In the long run, I think the bitcoin will end up mostly in the pockets of the existing rich people. And, it will create a lot of new wealthy people.\r\n\r\n<b>Advancement of Processing</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is speeding up the rate at which computation advances. This has huge impacts on the timelines of predicted processing power. There are 3 important milestones:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>All the computers on the planet are equivalent to one human brain</li>\r\n	<li>One computer is equivalent to one human brain</li>\r\n	<li>One computer is equivalent to all the human brains on the planet</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is comparing apples to oranges some would argue, but brains and computer processors are more similar than most people think. We may see some or all of these milestones achieved in our lifetime. The implications of these could be a theme of many books, so I can’t get into it too deeply. <a title=\"Stephen Hawkings\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Hawkings</a> has already warned us of AI.

If they sell too many, the price will plummet. If they hold onto them, the price should rise, but it will be lowered once they start to sell them. They will need to sell some of them to live a billionaire lifestyle. Not everybody accepts bitcoin as a payment. Even if they do accept bitcoin as a payment, then the bitcoin will be distributed more. Wealthy people will get their hands on their share of the bitcoin. They have to power to manipulate the bitcoin markets and get it from the early adopters for cheaper than what it will be worth. In the long run, I think the bitcoin will end up in the pockets of some of the existing rich people.\r\n\r\n<b>Advancement of Processing</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is speeding up the rate at which computation advances. This has huge impacts on the timelines of predicted processing power. There are 3 important milestones:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>All the computers on the planet are equivalent to one human brain</li>\r\n	<li>One computer is equivalent to one human brain</li>\r\n	<li>On computer is equivalent to all the human brains on the planet</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is comparing apples to oranges some would argue, but brains and computer processors are more similar than most people think. We may see some or all of these milestones achieved in our lifetime. The implications of these could be a theme of many books, so I can’t get into it too deeply. Stephen Hawkings has already warned us. If you are interested in learning more about this, I would suggest researching topics such as Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Data Mining and Natural Language Processing just to name a few.','Bitcoin Computing Power','','inherit','open','open','','35-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 02:30:33','2015-01-20 02:30:33','',35,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=36',0,'revision','',0),(37,1,'2015-01-20 03:21:44','2015-01-20 03:21:44','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-128\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg\" alt=\"Finance\" width=\"556\" height=\"360\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\r\n\r\nCredit cards are a pull technology. That is, when you go to purchase a service or product, you are giving your credit card and identification information and then they make a request for funds to your credit card company. The credit card company then authorizes the transaction resulting in the <i>pull transaction</i>. The company and anybody else can make this pull if they have your credit card information With bitcoin, you are sending money to the merchant directly. They don’t even have to authorize you to send them money. This is called a <i>push transaction</i>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Irreversible Transactions</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you send bitcoins to an address, there is no undoing this - it is an irreversible transaction. With credit cards and ACH, there is a wait period before the money is sent. Also, the money can only sent to merchants that have shared all of their information with the bank or credit card company. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, then the merchant will not receive the funds from the credit card company. The merchant, in turn, makes up for these losses by raising there prices. The consumer ends up paying for this. The credit card companies also advertise that they offer fraud protection, but it is really the merchant that is being forced to offer the fraud protection.\r\n\r\n<b>Centralization vs Decentralization</b>\r\n\r\nThere will have to be a balance between centralization and decentralization. Pure centralization would mean there is one large organization that controls everything. Pure decentralization would mean that each person contributes nearly an equal amount of effort to the system. There must be a balance between these two. We can’t go too far in  either direction or we won’t progress with technology. If we start heading in one direction, a revolutionary product will come out that will bring it back in the other direction. Look back at the mainframes - they were a centralized computer system where dumb terminals would connect to them. Then, we switched towards decentralization by having all the processing power in each individual device. More recently, we have gone back in the direction of centralization with cloud services. Bitcoin is a revolutionary service that is leaning towards decentralization - anybody can have a bank on their own computer. In the end, there will be computation going on everywhere - centralized and decentralized.\r\n\r\n<b>Risky Owning Lots of Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep hard copies of large quantities of bitcoins in fire proof safes or in an insured account - otherwise it is a risk and precautions need to be taken. Businesses surrounding safe bitcoin storage are arising. If bitcoins are not stored very carefully, they could be corrupted, lost or stolen. There have been countless tales of people losing bitcoins by computer crashes or having them stolen by hackers. $500,000,000.00, at the time of the theft, were stolen from customers on Mt. Gox.\r\n\r\nThe problem of safely storing large amounts of bitcoin will stop some investors from jumping on board right away. They will wait for an easy to understand and secure solution. They want their accounts to be insured by the FDIC. These services are being launched in Q1 2015. There is a market for professionals to advise wealthy individuals in purchasing bitcoin for their investment portfolio and this market will grow exponentially.\r\n\r\nIt is very dangerous to hold a large amount of cash since it can be lost or stolen. For Credit Cards, they pass the fraud expenses onto the businesses and customers. The loss is distributed more in CC - with bitcoin, it is more easy for an individual to get targeted and lose a lot. It would be a good general rule that if you have a large sum of bitcoins, then you better know exactly what you are doing or hire someone that knows what they are doing. And, make sure you trust the person that you hire - it would be easy for them to steal your bitcoins. Those bitcoins are almost certainly gone forever.\r\n\r\n<b>Banking for All</b>\r\n\r\nA high school student will have the power to run his or her own bank. A high school student from a 3rd world country will have the ability to run his or her own bank. 2/3’s of the worlds population does not have access to banking right now. Most of them have or will have mobile phones with internet access. They will be able to use Bitcoin and get access to the same banking systems that the rest of the world. They will be able to make orders for deliveries of items which otherwise might be more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the not too future, drones will be able to deliver items to places around the world. This is not going to happen for many years, but large companies are currently working on drones that deliver items to people’s doorsteps. If this method of delivering goods proves successful, which it will, then drone development will grow exponentially and we will have drones that can deliver anything, anywhere at anytime. Since Bitcoin can be easily used by anyone, anywhere, at any time and for any amount of money, it will align well with an international drone delivery system.\r\n\r\nSpaceX and Facebook have been looking to create satellites that will allow everybody on the planet to get on the internet. They will be providing cheap mobile phones for little to no costs. Facebook will be able to monetize the traffic from all the new users, so they have an incentive to move fast on this venture. These new people on the web will probably all be using Bitcoin for their financial needs - it is an international digital currency that allows any two parties anywhere on the planet to immediately exchange wealth for nearly free. I should say free since the costs will be absorbed by 3rd party apps that will monetize the traffic with advertisements.\r\n\r\nHistory has never allowed for such a huge leap in financial internationalization before. Gold and the USD came the closest to allowing this so far; Bitcoin is the next chapter in this process. There has already been a confirmed transaction from somebody from North Korea. It is rare and highly illegal for residents of North Korea to make financial contact with anyone outside the country.\r\n\r\n<b>Getting People on Board</b>\r\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle right now is getting people on board. Bitcoin has a bad name and it sounds like it is from a cartoon. People that never heard about Bitcoin before usually laugh when I try to explain it to them. One way to get people on board is by giving free and/or cheap bitcoins in order to get people to become familiar with the name Bitcoin and build trust in the Bitcoin system. For the average person, a very small amount, maybe $1, should be seeded to individuals that otherwise would not get into Bitcoin. For the wealthy people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. The bitcoins need to be re-distributed from the early adopters to a larger population in order to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream. The early adopters will still benefit because the value of the entire Bitcoin network goes up for each new person that starts using Bitcoin.

For the wealth people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. This would be bad for the early adopters but good to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream.\r\n\r\n<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. A system called Ripple might be able to accomplish this.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted lie TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin is Financial Tools','','inherit','open','open','','37-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 03:21:44','2015-01-20 03:21:44','',37,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=38',0,'revision','',0),(39,1,'2015-01-20 03:21:54','2015-01-20 03:21:54','<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\r\n\r\nCredit cards are a pull technology.

Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin is \"Financial Tools\"','','inherit','open','open','','37-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 03:21:54','2015-01-20 03:21:54','',37,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=39',0,'revision','',0),(40,1,'2015-01-20 03:40:14','2015-01-20 03:40:14','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8642373-digital-illustration-of-house-on-money-stack-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-145\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8642373-digital-illustration-of-house-on-money-stack-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Digital illustration of house on money stack\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Hoarders</b>\r\n\r\nHoarding will have to be balanced. If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoins, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some at fair market rate. The price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. The price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoins - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoins ever and there is currently about 14,000,000 as of early 2015. Most bitcoins have already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoins per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoins per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoins - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with Bitcoin since bitcoins are fluid. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even in virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency that can be used for real tangible products. A two-way virtual currency is one that can be converted from USD and back. Most virtual currencies are one way - you can trade USD for the virtual currency but you can\'t trade the virtual currency for USD. Bitcoin is different since it has so many uses.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have not yet been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be innovative products that will allow Bitcoin to be used more conveniently than the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount of wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers” or just lucky. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering. Some individuals that have large amounts of bitcoins could become billionaires if Bitcoin goes main stream. You can view the <a href=\"http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100\">BitcoinRichList</a>. The numbers are actually worse than what is displayed at that website. Most large holders of bitcoins have their bitcoins spread out among many different addresses. There are a small number of people that own a large percentage of the bitcoins. This is also true for most currencies and stocks.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nPeople have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current payment methods illegal? They could try to ban Bitcoin stating \"<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\">Terrorists Use Bitcoin</a>\". The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. Some nations are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country\">banning Bitcoin</a>. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is nearly doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue or accelerate.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin will continue to maintain its\' price over the long run. It is unique and valuable. It can\'t die because the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35\">Bitcoin network</a> is too powerful. I don\'t see that Bitcoin will be replaced since it is a protocol that can be updated upon agreement of the community. If some feature is desired and the community agrees that it is good, then it should be incorporated into the protocol. This is similar to the HTTP and WWW protocol. The network won\'t be replaced by a superior technology since it can be updated. For the short term, Bitcoin will be volatile - that is, the price will fluctuate up and down. You may purchase bitcoins and find out that it lost 30% of its price in a week. However, the average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since it was first launched in 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting to buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time they will buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market. However, this volatility should go away as more people are in the market. More people will buy bitcoins when the price goes down and sell bitcoins when the price goes up. This will stop spikes and crashes. The more people that are in Bitcoin, the more pressure there will be on the price. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is low and buy thus bringing the price up. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is high and sell thus bring the price down. Over time, the price will continue to increase just as it has been doing since 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Price</b>\r\n\r\nThe price of a single bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. These trades will set the current price. The latest trade price will be the advertised current price of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand.\r\n\r\nSome people think that a single bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the price will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are currently hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s and growing every month. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of a bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $200 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$400. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin and it won\'t stay above what it costs to mine for any significant period of time.\r\n\r\nI would approximate that it costs about $150 to mine a bitcoin in an industrial setting. It costs $200+ to mine one from home. Whatever the price to mine a bitcoin, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. Overtime, the rewards to mine get cut in half, so it becomes more expensive to mine. Once that happens, the price should rise. Also, if demand is greater than the number of bitcoins mined, then the price will rise. If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\r\n\r\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoins will be redirected to purchasing bitcoins directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that the price of a bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into Bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoins immediately after receiving them - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how Bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the price of a bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoins for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoins and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoins and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-investments','','http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35','2015-01-31 05:42:05','2015-01-31 05:42:05','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=40',0,'post','',0),(41,1,'2015-01-20 03:40:14','2015-01-20 03:40:14','<b>Bitcoin Hoarders</b>\r\n\r\nHoarding will have to be balanced.

This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Printing Hard Copy of Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be possible to have a wallet containing bitcoin converted to paper. Further, someone could verify that the paper wallet still contains the bitcoin. This would be done with a barcode. The password could be built into the barcode, so that it could be redeemed by whoever possesses it. A potential security problem for this would be that someone could steal it by taking a picture of it. A scratch off surface such as on lottery tickets could be utilized. A trusted corporation could manufacture a large number of these scratch cards and sell them at a small mark-up. It would be a huge business. The government is not as efficient as the free market! There have already been offline hard versions of bitcoin created <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins\">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins</a> Casascius. These physical coins can hold value of 1, 10, 100 or 1000 bitcoins. I have a feeling there will be a version two of these items in smaller decrements and cheaper mediums like scratch off tickets.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice.

It should be looked at more like the next telephone, internet or e-mail. It is the next step in the evolution of technology on our planet. I wouldn\'t be surprised if there are other intelligent life forms in our universe that use, have used, or will use some form of crypto-currency during their evolution.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers”.

The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is near doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue.\r\n\r\n<b>“The” Money of the Future</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin will not be “the” money of the future. It will be “a” money of the future. It will have applicability in the international free market. The free markets in the world have always won and caused for greater innovation. Markets that are not free will fall behind the free markets since a free market sparks the greatest innovation. People can competitively attempt to solve problems.  Humans are naturally a competitive species. It is the only way we can prosper.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Credit &amp; Financing</b>\r\n\r\nPeople want credit. There is currently no credit with Bitcoin. You will not, yet, get the same 0% APR for 18 months with a $10,000 limit as easily as you could with VISA/MasterCard/American Express/Discover. People would rather spend money that they don’t have to pay immediately. Most people have debt that they would rather put that money towards so they don’t have to pay interest on it. That entire concept is another story. Hopefully, there will be Bitcoin credit cards where people with excellent credit can get a 10 bitcoin credit where they must pay back just like they do with current credit cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nEven if Bitcoin is replaced with a superior digital currency, it will continue to maintain some value. Whether it will be a collector’s item in the future or adopted as the mainstream digital currency is a thought to ponder. I’m certain that a competitor to the current financial system will come into existence.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down.

I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$600. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin. I would approximate it that it costs at least $200 a bitcoin to mine. That might not be accurate, but whatever the price is, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. If the price does fall below, the money used to mine bitcoin will be redirected to purchasing bitcoin directly from the people that already own bitcoin.

People are psychological creatures and 1 bitcoin will be a milestone for someone to own. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket. There does not yet exist 14 million bitcoin and it will not happen for at least a few months into 2015. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. 90% of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and people that got into bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoin immediately after receiving it. If this is how bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while.

Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this as an important factor.\r\n\r\n<b>Balancing Account</b>\r\n\r\nSome variation of a spending &amp; saving account could conceptually be created. They would contain an equal amount of bitcoin and dollar when adding funds to it could be used to maximize saving and spending. If the price of bitcoin has fallen since making a deposit, then spend cash on the current purchase. If the price of bitcoin has risen since making a deposit, then spend bitcoin on the current purchase.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital Funds In General</b><strong><strong>\r\n</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nPeople are going to want an international digital currency. People want access to their funds in any currency that they would want online. This needs to be done without the user having to do any manual actions.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Arbitrage</b>\r\n\r\nArbitrage is when investors buy a bitcoin from one exchange at a lower price and sell it at another price for a higher price. This balances the price between the exchanges. It can be profitable for the investors engaged in this activity. It is a risk, though. If the price is crashing before they make the buy and sell.\r\n\r\n<b>Outsourcing Financing to Machines</b><strong><strong>\r\n</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nBitcoin can manage financing for cheaper than the current banks. The overhead to support all of the millionaires and billionaires in our current financial markets is overwhelming. The rich are feeding off of the economy one transaction at a time.\r\n\r\n<b>Trading Stocks</b>\r\n\r\nThe value of a stock counts on the value of the service that the business provides. Bitcoin has a valuable service. The value of this service will be reflected in the value of a single bitcoin and in the value of the businesses surrounding bitcoin. As long as the 51% of the servers is not taken over by a malicious attacker, then bitcoin should retain some value. Even if the 51% attack was to happen, there would be a fork that the rest of the community would start moving forward with.\r\n\r\n<b>Infinitely Divisible</b>\r\n\r\nA bitcoin can be divided up to very small parts. My sample wallet address 1HdXXkqjmHcTdX5FyMMUkARP6i4rtr1C74 from Bitcoin Core currently states a balance of 0.00007303 BTC.\r\n\r\n<b>Volatility Insurance</b>\r\n\r\nCompanies are afraid to hold onto bitcoin that they receive because it could go down by 20% in the next few days. That would make them lose money on a sale. An insurance to cover volatility could be created. It could be commission based on the fluctuations. The insurance company would collect a percentage of the increase in value in an exchange to cover the dips in value. This would take the risk out of a crash for some companies that may hold bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin is a Trustless Currency</b>\r\n\r\nThe parties do not need to trust each other for an exchange to happen. For credit cards and ACH, a lot of trust is required. That is not so much for the credit card case, but it is not a good experience to have your credit card numbers stolen. Your credit card company is responsible to cover any unauthorized purchases on your account. With bitcoin, if you use it properly, somebody can’t steal any bitcoin from you if you don’t give them your password and/or private key.\r\n\r\n<b>Insured Bitcoin Accounts</b>\r\n\r\nThere are currently insured accounts available at some exchanges. I’m sure more will grow. They are responsible for any bitcoin that was lost or stolen because of them. This includes hackers attacking their systems. It does not include someone getting ahold of your username and password. Also, they usually have 2 factor authentication so they would need your password and either your email or cellphone authentication. Authentication would be done by sending an e-mail with a confirmation link or sending a text message with a confirmation code that needs to be entered into the site before a transaction can take place. Fund that are stolen from a traditional debit card are usually not insured. However, funds stolen off of a credit card are usually covered by the credit card company. Those funds come from the consumers through fees and high interest rates. The problem with insurance is relatively easy to address for Bitcoin. Corporations will provide this service. They will need to make a profit for that service, so bitcoin holders that choose these services will probably pay for them. Some companies make their profits through other ways that will offload the costs to the customer.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 03:40:14','2015-01-20 03:40:14','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=41',0,'revision','',0),(42,1,'2015-01-20 03:44:31','2015-01-20 03:44:31','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-151\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\" alt=\"nuclear bomb explosion\" width=\"447\" height=\"447\" /></a></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\n\r\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two nations won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have the potential to destroy the other. Like a nuclear war between superpowers, there can be no winners. The Bitcoin network lives on the same principle. Too many people have investments in Bitcoin to allow it to fail. Nobody would benefit from somebody breaking the integrity of Bitcoin. If someone pulls a 51% attack, then people would lose the trust in the system and bitcoin would lose all of its value. The perpetrators would make now gains because the system would be destroyed. Any parties that are interested in Bitcoin will attempt to prevent such an attack. The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin network and their supporters will back the integrity of the system.\r\n\r\nGovernments will back the integrity of the system because they are obligated to protect their citizens\' interests. However, there will be controversy when governments attempt to freeze wallet addresses on the blockchain that contain illegally obtained bitcoin. The protocol does not currently support these freezes, but could governments force such a change? Scroll down to read about the proposed Hot List.\r\n\r\n<b>Network of Trust</b>\r\n\r\nIf all the parties can come to a fair agreement of how much hashing power is needed, then there wouldn\'t need to be a race to the bottom by wasting efforts on mining. It is naturally competitive as to reward the parties with the most hashing power. This agreement will not come as a verbal agreement between the parties but it will be agreed upon naturally through the price of a bitcoin.\r\n\r\nLike in real life, no one party will want to take over more than 51% of the network because the value of the system would dwindle and their profits would dwindle. There will always be several large competitors that will prevent any one entity from controlling 51% of the network.\r\n\r\nSomeone that has control of 51% of the network will want to keep the integrity of the transactions - they would not benefit from altering any information in the network. The system will maintain a natural balance between people around the world - they will want to be friendly with each other. A majority of people are good and the network is an image of the miners and users of Bitcoin. It is a natural trust based system with laws to hold integrity.\r\n\r\nThe price of a bitcoin will be worth what people will make it worth. People will naturally make the Bitcoin network worth the services that it provides. If it does provide all the services of banking and credit cards and a whole lot more, then it will be extremely valuable. All parties that are involved with Bitcoin will want it to continue to succeed. An attack from outside the bitcoin network would be the most likely since Bitcoin competitors would benefit from the system failing. However, it would be cheaper for an outside party to buy into the network and try to control it from within. Terrorists will not ever acquire enough power to take down 51% of the network. Governments may have the power to do this. But, the governments that have that much power would be able to acquire control of much of bitcoin through mining and purchasing bitcoin. Also, governments are obligated to protect their citizens\' assets.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin vs Manual Audits</b>\r\n\r\nA transaction and store of value system like the current financial institutions use manual audits to ensure the integrity of their network. Any business can be audited to make sure all transactions are accurate and complete. If they are not, they will suffer legal consequences. Is the current setup of audits more efficient than Bitcoin mining? I would say no since the credit card and bank fees are so high. A competitor, like Bitcoin, will ensure that the financial institutions are working as efficiently as possible because if they don\'t, then their customers may leave. The financial institutions will have to be able to compete with the services that Bitcoin is offering and they have to do it with either more quality, better security, or for cheaper. Options are always a good thing for consumers. It will force the financial sector to compete for customers. They may use many methods to compete.\r\n\r\n<b>Attention in Media</b>\r\n\r\nIt can be profitable for news agencies to report on the fallacies of Bitcoin. These reports, in turn, make Bitcoin less valuable. It is a downward spiral. However, people communicate with each other. There are lots of more people using Bitcoin and their are <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">statistics</a> to prove it. They will teach their friends of its’ advantages. Their friends will teach their friends and that cycle will continue until the general public is educated about the facts of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Community Agrees To Update</b>\r\n\r\nIf a general consensus among the Bitcoin miners agree to change the protocol, then this could have significant implications for the digital currency. This happens a lot for minor updates and is discussed in the Bitcoin community for major changes. A hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin miners might want to change the having of Bitcoin rewards to every 8 years instead of every 4 years is possible, but it is unlikely that a majority of people would agree to that. It would be profitable for the miners to do such a thing. But, this would cause belief in the system to dwindle and hurt them more than reward them.\r\n\r\nPeople value bitcoin as a store of wealth and unethical changes to the protocol would cause the price to plummet. Many miners are deeply vested into Bitcoin and they do not want this to happen because it would not be beneficial to them. If something like this did happen, there would probably be a fork and the existing version would run in parallel to the new version. That would be terrible for the system for everyone involved. People would have to decide which fork to choose between. Current holders would want the old version and people that want to get on board might want the new version. I think that the community would see all the struggles that taking such an action would cause and they would not want to damage the market that they exist in. These scenarios are hypothetical and not practical.\r\n\r\n<b>Fork</b>\r\n\r\nA fork in Bitcoin is when there are two separate versions that have been worked on and they share a previous point where they were the same - they share a common ancestor. For example, github hosts software projects for developers and when someone has a public project up there, someone else could fork a copy of the current version and start working on it in parallel. The original developer would also be working on the original version. They could both save their copies and they would be different and not share the changes that were made by both of the parties. Some people suggest that a fork in the bitcoin could be used. It would take a majority of the miners to approve a different version that will be accepted by the community. In practice, there would be an overwhelming majority that agrees to any updates because it would not be beneficial to anyone otherwise. It would be a guaranteed loss for everyone!\r\n\r\nIn the event that a successful 51% attack on the system happens, there would be a fork with the 49% that maintains the integrity. Users would have to ensure they are using the \"good\" fork. This attack is theoretically possible but in practice, it is impossible.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot List</b>\r\n\r\nHypothetically, there could be a hot list added to Bitcoin. If enough miners agreed to update the core code, then a hot list of addresses holding stolen bitcoins could be frozen. They would then be able to use them for legitimate uses. This would render those bitcoins nearly useless and it would make it not so profitable for bad people to steal bitcoins from people. This would be hard to maintain and it should be hard for a person to place addresses in a hot list but it would be beneficial for the entire system and help it be accepted in the mainstream. The original holder of the bitcoins would have to prove that the bitcoins do indeed belong to them. Once it is on the host list, it would be worth little to nothing. This might even influence some hackers to give the bitcoin back for an agreed small percentage of legal bitcoin. This hot list would probably only be feasible for large thefts.\r\n\r\n<b>Charitable Donations</b>\r\n\r\nWhen you donate money to a 3rd world country, not all of that money reaches there. If you wanted to donate $1, probably about $0.10 will reach the hungry child that you wanted to feed and the other $0.90 ends up going to the 3rd parties in between. With Bitcoin, it will be possible to donate $1 to starving children and $1 will reach its targeted donation. The implications of what Bitcoin could do for the world are huge. It is <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">arguably free</a> to use! There will be 3rd party applications that will absorb any costs to send money. The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\r\n\r\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes. This is currently the case, but it is easy to convert bitcoins to USD and possibly in the future, the IRS might reconsider. NYC is proposing allowing people to <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/31/new-york-parking-ticket-app/\">pay parking tickets with bitcoins</a>. This would save the people and the city a lot of money in financial fees with credit cards and the costs associated with mailing checks. Bitcoin would be useful for collecting tolls on highways for the same reasons. People could get a sticker on their car and have the payment automatically go through. This would save the highway management and people money by cutting out the banks from the middle of the transaction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin Theories & Concepts','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-theories-concepts','','\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97','2015-01-31 06:32:43','2015-01-31 06:32:43','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=42',0,'post','',0),(43,1,'2015-01-20 03:44:31','2015-01-20 03:44:31','<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\n\r\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two countries won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have to potential to destroy the other. Like a nuclear war between superpowers, there can be no winners. The Bitcoin network lives on the principle. Too many people have investments in Bitcoin to allow it to fail. Nobody would benefit from somebody breaking the integrity of Bitcoin. If someone pulls a 51% attack, then people would lose the trust in the system and bitcoin would lose all of its value. Any parties that are interested in Bitcoin will attempt to prevent such an attack. The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin network and their supporters would back the integrity of the system. Governments will back the integrity of the system. However, there will be controversy when governments start freezing wallet addresses on the blockchain that contain illegally obtained bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Network of Trust</b>\r\n\r\nIf all the parties can come to a fair agreement of how much hashing power, then there wouldn\'t need to be a race to the bottom by wasting efforts on mining. It is naturally competitive as to reward the parties with the most hashing power. Like in real life, no one party will want to take over more than 51% because the value of the system will dwindle.

Any business can be audited to make sure all transactions are accurate and complete. Is the current setup of checks and balances more efficient than Bitcoin mining? I can’t answer that for sure, but a competitor, like Bitcoin, will ensure that the financial institutions are working as efficiently as possible. They will have to be able to compete with the services that Bitcoin is offering and they have to do it with either more quality or for cheaper. Options are always a good thing for consumers. It will force the financial sector to compete for customers.

They will teach their friends of its’ advantages. Their friends will teach their friends and that cycle will continue until the general public is educated about the facts of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Weakness: Destroy bitcoins</b>\r\n\r\nIf wealthy and powerful people wanted to, they could slowly buy the bitcoin up and destroy them. This would take them out of the market. This would also drive up the price of bitcoin and have people not want to buy in. However, destroying bitcoins may drive up the value of the existing bitcoins in circulation. Limiting circulation of Bitcoin will certainly devalue it. It might be a weakness in Bitcoin that could be exploited by the Bitcoin opposition. This would induce people to sell their bitcoins when the price rises especially at what looks like the end of a bubble or beginning of a crash. The extremely wealthy has enough wealth to swing the bitcoin price and get a hold of a vast majority of bitcoins and then destroy them. The strategy could easily backfire and only make Bitcoin more popular. This is a purely speculative theory which is very unlikely, but it is not impossible.\r\n\r\n<b>Community Agrees To Update</b>\r\n\r\nIf a general consensus among the Bitcoin miners agree to change the protocol, then this could have significant implications for the digital currency. This happens a lot for minor updates and is discussed in the Bitcoin community for major changes. There are scenarios where Bitcoin miners might want to change the having of Bitcoin rewards to every 8 years instead of every 4 years. I doubt that there would be a 51% or more agreeing to that in the community. It would be profitable for the miners to do such a thing. But, this would cause belief in the system to dwindle. People value bitcoin as a store of value and the price would plummet. Many miners are deeply vested into Bitcoin and they do not want this to happen because it would not be beneficial to them in the long run. This goes against the fundamental principles of a majority of the mining community. I don’t think that would happen. If it did, there would probably be a fork and the existing version would run in parallel to the new version. Then people would have to decide which fork to choose between. Current holders would want the old version and people that want to get on board and the miners might want the new version. I think that the community would see all the struggles that taking such an action would cause and they would not want to damage the market that they exist in.\r\n\r\n<b>Fork</b>\r\n\r\nA fork is in Bitcoin is when there are two separate version that have been worked on and they share a previous point where they were the same.

Some people suggest that a fork in the bitcoin could be used. It would take a majority of the miners to approve a different version that will be accepted by the community.\r\n\r\n<b>Alternative Uses</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of people are hoping that bitcoin will be used by the mainstream for daily purchases. I think it will be used by a niche and be very good at what it does. My guess is that it will be used mostly for:\r\n\r\nA store of wealth\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Investment</li>\r\n	<li>Online Micro-purchases</li>\r\n	<li>Online Tipping</li>\r\n	<li>Transfer of wealth between individuals</li>\r\n	<li>Banking &amp; Currency for Undeveloped Countries</li>\r\n	<li>Buying Illegal Goods &amp; Services</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Hot List</b>\r\n\r\nThere could be a hot list added to Bitcoin. If enough miners agreed to update the core code, then  hot list of addresses holding stolen bitcoin could be frozen. This would render them unspendable to make it not so profitable for bad people to steal bitcoin from people. This would be hard to maintain and it should be hard for a person to place addresses in their but it would be beneficial. The original holder of the bitcoin would have to prove that the bitcoin is indeed theres. Once it is on the host list, it would be worth little to nothing. This might even influence some hackers to give the bitcoin back for an agreed small percentage of legal bitcoin.\r\n\r\n<b>Charitable Donations</b>\r\n\r\nWhen you donate money to a 3rd world country, not all of that money reaches there. [todo: find some percentages]. If you wanted to donate $1, probably about $0.10 will reach the hunger child that you wanted to feed. With Bitcoin, it will be possible to donate $1 to starving children and $1 will reach its targeted donation. The implications of what Bitcoin could do for the world are huge. It is a nearly free to use money transfer system. There will be applications where it will be absolutely free to send money. The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\r\n\r\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime in 2017. This keeps getting cut in half every four years until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. There is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out how much a bitcoin is worth. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. Who could have imagined something like this even 20 years ago? I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there. I use it as my little hobby/work room and it is free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore because of the costs. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoin until they, hopefully, reach higher levels. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. The only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? But, it creates the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Miners Selling Cloud Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years. Since the ASICs for bitcoin mining came into existence over the past couple of years, the computational power for the bitcoin mining computers has doubled every 6 months and it appears as though this doubling every 6 months will continue here on forward.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining Exchange</b>\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahertz, exahertz, zettahertz or yottahertz. Those are real words, too! petahertz means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahertz means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The network is currently around 300,000,000 hertz.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. It will mine, by contributing a certain number of gigahash per second. Providing these gigahash costs electricity. The mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor of difficulty that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. During price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 13,000 times higher than the world 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn’t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. However, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 13,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

It is easy to write a computer program to accept an incoming transfer and then break it up and send a piece of it to several different addresses. The bitcoins that get sent around won\'t have the fees attached to them like what happens in the market now. It is programmable because it is easy to write a program that automatically distributes funds based on actions the users take while using a computer application.\r\n\r\nVisualize this scenario:\r\n<blockquote>A third party wants to accept donations and divide it between several charities. This would be too expensive to do with credit cards and bank transfers. This can\'t be completed or verified immediately either. Now someone will be able to donate $0.25 to their favorite 50 charities that they choose with a click of a button. Each of those charities will be able to receive a half penny. This will only count as one transaction on the blockchain since there can be multiple receiving addresses in a single transaction. It is immediately verified that the charitable addresses received the donation. This can all be done programmatically.</blockquote>\r\nThat is just one demonstration of how it is programmable. There are many other justifications as to why Bitcoin is more programmable than the USD. The USD takes days for transactions to clear and Credit Cards can take up to months before the transaction is cleared and the funds are available to the parties. Most banks and financial institutions have barriers to allowing money to be so easily distributed and utilized via a computer program.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the international community of businesses and individuals to cooperate financially with the current financial instruments available to them. With Bitcoin, essentially any individual or group of individuals can create and maintain their own bank. They can write the programs to do whatever they can imagine with their bitcoins. The program can send and receive funds with the only limit being its\' creators imagination. That is difficult to do with cash. When you send old-fashioned money, you are really just sending a note for your bank to transfer the funds to them. There is a physical presence of that money that needs to be maintained. There is no guarantee of payment with USD until you get the money physically. The Bitcoin you receive is guaranteed to be yours as soon as the financial transaction is verified by the network and recorded on the blockchain.

These could all be created in a similar fashion. They would cut out the big players that are making a huge cut in users online activities. If a community of servers could solve problems like search, social networks, shopping, almost any human to human interaction that we do with a computer. There could be nodes like “miners” in Bitcoin that would contain the correct answers for user queries. The network could intelligently organize any information and reward the organizers. An open source catalog could contain a valid list of the cheapest products that anybody could purchase. All of the computers would work together to locate the best available products for the lowest price. The network could connect commerce with consumers and cut out the costs of large third parties. The nodes that manage the network would be rewarded with commissions if they behave well. If they try to mess up the results, the rest of the network would find out and cut them out for new traffic immediately. This would be a decentralization of the network. Peer-to-peer networks work great for content sharing and currency, why isn\'t it used for other popular online activities?<strong>\n</strong>\n\n<b>Web 3.0</b>\n\nIt is the internationalization of the web. People of any language will be able to communicate financially as well as through text and audio/video. You will have a store of wealth online that can easily be transferred to others at your whim. You will be free from corporations and governments limiting your freedoms. It will allow computing resources to be used just like a currency.\n\n<b>Online Activities Have Too Many Fees</b>\n\nAn open and distributed network of e-books can be created to allow for publishers to connect directly with their readers. There is no need for corporations to have a monopoly on the system and take huge cuts. Some of the cuts that they take go to pay the banks the fees for their transactions. Bitcoin takes the banks out of the transactions between merchants and consumers. This model of centralized businesses is taking too much of the money away from the the merchants and consumers. The same principle can be applied to advertisements, e-commerce and search engines.\n\n<b>Post E-Finance</b>\n\nWhat happens after technology takes over finance? Is the next sight on politics? Will computers handle international laws just as they are starting to handle international financial transactions? There might be an autonomous system where there are an agreed upon set of laws. The system will be able to monitor all people and enforce the laws. There will be no single person or groups of people that can go around the the international laws. As scary as it sounds, this might be a good thing. The system would be much more efficient than the current system since there are so many loopholes and contradictions in laws across borders.\n\nWill there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what it is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\n\n<b>Bitcoin For Voting &amp; Authority</b>\n\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications. A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to up-vote it and down-vote it. The more up-votes, the more bitcoins the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoins back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population.\n\nIf content gets all down-votes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam. I think those articles could be spotted by requiring at least a few people to see it. Users would have a power attribute. Users that make \"good\" votes could have increased power. Maybe they could upvote by +1, +2 and +3 and downvote -1, -2, -3.\n\nVoters could be shown some guidelines to not downvote a controversial issue. Sometimes a large percentage of the population has bad feelings towards some issues that were illegal or immoral that might now be regarded as legal and moral. Some of the bitcoin generated from the bad content could also be given to the customers that view the content. This could be done with money but the fees might be too high for content creators to put up a deposit. A content creator might only want to <i>and need to</i> put up $0.25 for their content. That would be impossible to do with a credit card. Amateurs might spend years attempting to create good content and want to try to publish it, but they don’t have money to pay for advertising.\n\nThe large search engines are good for organizing content so that people can find it, but they typically favor the same large media outlets. They also place a lot of advertisements that would avert users away from finding their content. This would also entice advertisers to produce better content and pay the users for finding it. That money currently goes to the large search engines and advertisers. And, there is a ton of money going to them - that money could stay between the online services providers and the customers.\n\nThis system would also hurt entities that attempted to make bad content because they would have to fork over some deposit. Add that to all the money that the merchants and customers save from having to “pay” for advertisements. Both the merchants and the customers pay for those advertisements because the merchant relies on the advertisement to reach the customer. The merchant then has to raise the price of the product to make a profit. The customer pays the increased fee.\n\nWhen someone is at shopping sites, the shopping site and banking system take in a large amount of profits from their merchants and customers. A new system could be created that could cut them out. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men really can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks, online social networks, etc... There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the international community.\n\n<b>Opinion</b>\n\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than the current services if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\n\n<b>Alt-coins</b>\n\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it. Bitcoin is already \"the\" digital currency and it would be difficult for an alternative to surpass it.\n\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\n\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be possible. However, the heat giving off from mining could be a valuable resource. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\n\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\n\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits. Bitcoin offers new &amp; improved services over the old.\n\n<b>Crazy Claims</b>\n\nTo claim that Bitcoin can provide all the services of the Banks, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Western Union to name a few sounds crazy, but they all store and exchange wealth. Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth. The part about storing wealth might be argued against since people that bought at $1100 and now it is at $275, but this is probably just a dip in a long-term rising value.','Bitcoin is More than a Virtual Currency','','inherit','open','open','','33-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-27 00:13:18','2015-01-27 00:13:18','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=46',0,'revision','',0),(47,1,'2015-01-20 21:56:23','2015-01-20 21:56:23','<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\r\n\r\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks.

It is easier for a computer program to accept an incoming transfer and then break it up and send a piece of it to several different addresses. The bitcoins that get sent around won\'t have the fees attached to them like what happens in the market now.\r\n\r\nVisualize this scenario:\r\n<blockquote>A third party wants to accept donations and divide it between several charities. This would be too expensive to do with credit cards and bank transfers. They can\'t be done immediately that way either. They can not be immediately verified either. Now someone will be able to donate $0.25 to their favorite 50 charities that they choose. Each of those charities will be able to receive a half penny. This will only count as one transaction on the blockchain since there can be multiple receiving addresses in a single transaction. It is immediately verified that the charitable addresses received the donation. This can all be done programmatically.</blockquote>\r\nThat is just one demonstration of how it is programmable. There are many other justifications as to why Bitcoin is more programmable than the USD. The USD takes days for transactions to clear and Credit Cards can take up to months before the transaction is cleared and the funds are available to the parties. Most banks and financial institutions have barriers to this. It is difficult for the international community of businesses and individuals to cooperate financially with the current financial instruments available to them. Essentially, any individual or group of individuals can create and maintain there own bank. They can write the programs to do whatever they can imagine with those funds. That is difficult to do with cash. When you send money, they are getting a note for your bank to transfer the funds to you. There is a physical presence of that money that needs to be maintained. There is no guarantee of payment with USD until you get the money physically. The Bitcoin you receive is guaranteed to be yours as soon as the financial transaction is verified by the network and recorded on the blockchain. This allows the money to be easily controlled by computer programs. Bitcoin essentially delegates financial markets to computer systems.','Bitcoin is Programmable Money','','inherit','open','open','','45-revision-v1','','','2015-01-20 22:10:06','2015-01-20 22:10:06','',45,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=48',0,'revision','',0),(49,1,'2015-01-20 22:59:32','2015-01-20 22:59:32','<strong><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/financial-problems-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/financial-problems-xs.jpg\" alt=\"The decision of financial problems.\" width=\"547\" height=\"365\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Financial Problems</strong>\r\n\r\nThe international community is unable to efficiently &amp; securely make financial transactions with each other.

For example, try to make a $0.50 purchase online from a company in a different nation. The fees are too high for the merchant - the bank will make more than the merchant. The merchant will have to wait a significant amount of time before having 100% possession of the money - it can be as long as 6 months before the credit cards fully confirm a purchase. And, the credit card transaction will probably fail and force you to manually confirm the purchase directly with your credit card company. And, you do not want to upload your checking account information to some foreigners database for a $0.50 purchase or any size purchase. This makes international commerce nearly impossible.

I will also give my personal opinion on Bitcoin and go over other peoples opinions. I will discuss everything and anything involving Bitcoin. If you have any topics that you would like me to write about that is related to Bitcoin, please leave a comment below! If I can respond in the comment, I will do that. If your inquiry deserves a full article, then I will write an article.','Introducing Bitcoin USD','','inherit','open','open','','4-revision-v1','','','2015-01-21 02:21:11','2015-01-21 02:21:11','',4,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=53',0,'revision','',0),(54,1,'2015-01-21 02:24:42','2015-01-21 02:24:42','','introducingbitcoinusd','','inherit','open','open','','introducingbitcoinusd-2','','','2015-01-21 02:24:42','2015-01-21 02:24:42','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd1.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(55,1,'2015-01-21 02:25:12','2015-01-21 02:25:12','','bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency','','inherit','open','open','','bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency','','','2015-01-21 02:25:12','2015-01-21 02:25:12','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(56,1,'2015-01-21 02:26:02','2015-01-21 02:26:02','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\" alt=\"bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\r\n\r\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks. These could all be created in a similar fashion. They would cut out the big players that are making a huge cut in users online activities. If a community of servers could solve problems like search, social networks, shopping, almost any human to human interaction that we do with a computer. There could be nodes like “miners” in Bitcoin that would contain the correct answers for user queries. The network could intelligently organize any information and reward the organizers. An open source catalog could contain a valid list of the cheapest products that anybody could purchase. All of the computers would work together to locate the best available products for the lowest price. The could connect businesses with consumers and cut out the costs of a third party like Amazon.<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Web 3.0</b>\r\n\r\nIt is the internationalization of the web. People of any language will be able to communicate without any problems. Your agreements online will be official in what is called smart contracts. You will have a store of wealth online that can easily be transferred to others. You will be free from corporations and governments limiting your freedoms. It will allow computing resources to be used almost like a currency.\r\n\r\n<b>E-Books/Ads/Search/e-Commerce Have Too Many Fees</b>\r\n\r\nAn open and distributed network of e-books can be created to allow for publishers to connect directly with their readers. There is no need for companies like Amazon to take huge cuts. Amazon uses their cuts to pay the banks the fees for the transactions. This model of centralized businesses takes too much money away from the the merchants and consumers. The same principle can be applied to advertisements, e-commerce and search engines.\r\n\r\n<b>Post E-Finance</b>\r\n\r\nWhat happens after technology takes over finance? Is the next sight on politics? Will computers handle international laws as they are starting to handle all financial transactions? There might be a autonomous system where there are an agreed upon set of laws. The system will be able to monitor all people and enforce the laws. There will be no single person that can go around the current laws. The system would be much more efficient than the current system since there are so many loopholes and contradictions in laws across borders. Will there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin For Voting &amp; Authority</b>\r\n\r\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications. A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to upvote it and downvote it. The more upvotes, the more bitcoin the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoin back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population. If it gets all downvotes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam. I think those articles could be spotted by requiring at least a few people see it and they could have a power attribute to the votes. Maybe they could upvote by +1, +2 and +3 and downvote -1, -2, -3. Voters could be shown some guidelines to not downvote a controversial issue. Sometimes a large percentage of the population has bad feelings towards some issues that were illegal or immoral that might now be regarded as legal and moral. Some of the bitcoin generated from the bad content could also be given to the customers that view the content. This could be done with money but the fees might be too high for content creators to put up a deposit. A content creator might only want to <i>and need to</i> put up $0.25 for their content. That would be impossible to do with a credit card. Amateurs might spend years attempting to create good content and want to try to publish it, but they don’t have money to pay for advertising. The large search engines is good for organizing content so that people can find it, but they typically favor the same large media outlets. They also place a lot of advertisements that would avert users away from finding their content. This would also entice advertisers to produce better content and pay the users for finding it. That money currently goes to the large search engines and advertisers. And, there is a ton of money going to them - that money could stay between the merchants and the customers. All of the money that gets paid to the search engines would remain in the pockets of the merchants and the customers. This system would also hurt entities that attempted to make bad content because they would have to fork over all their bitcoin to the customers and merchants. Add that to all the money that the merchants and customers save from having to “pay” for advertisements. Both the merchants and the customers pay for those advertisements because the merchant relies on the advertisement to reach the customer. The merchant then has to raise the price of the product to make a profit. The customer pays the increased fee. When you shop at shopping sites, the shopping site takes in a large amount of profits from their merchants and customers. A new system could be created that cut them out and give those profits directly to the merchants and customers. With well trained customers and merchants, the middle men can be cut out. When I say middle men, I mean the advertising companies, credit card companies, banks, online shopping networks. There could be more free and open international systems that are not owned by nations and corporations but are owned by the most efficient 3rd parties.\r\n\r\n<b>Digital Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nA third-party could use Bitcoin to create digital wallets. One user could create and store the first half of the password and the other user could create and store the second half of the password. This could help parties come into an agreement without as much risk. If one party does not honor their commitments, then the funds are stuck in the wallet forever. This could entice both sides of the parties to honor their agreements.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than western union and paypal if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\r\n\r\n<b>Altcoins</b>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it.\r\n\r\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\r\n\r\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be conceivably built. However, the heat giving off from mining is, in my mind, just as a valuable resource as the processing that is going on. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\r\n\r\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\r\n\r\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits. Bitcoin offers new &amp; improved services over the old.\r\n\r\n<b>Crazy Claims</b>\r\n\r\nTo claim that Bitcoin can provide all the services of the Banks, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Western Union to name a few sounds crazy, but they all store and exchange wealth. Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth. The part about storing wealth might be argued against since people that bought at $1100 and now it is at $275, but this is probably just a dip in a long-term rising value.','Bitcoin is More than a Virtual Currency','','inherit','open','open','','33-revision-v1','','','2015-01-21 02:26:02','2015-01-21 02:26:02','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=56',0,'revision','',0),(57,1,'2015-01-21 02:32:05','2015-01-21 02:32:05','','bitcoindynamics','','inherit','open','open','','bitcoindynamics','','','2015-01-21 02:32:05','2015-01-21 02:32:05','',24,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(58,1,'2015-01-21 02:33:03','2015-01-21 02:33:03','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-57\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 30px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoindynamics.gif\" alt=\"bitcoindynamics\" width=\"140\" height=\"260\" /></a>Amplification</b>\r\n\r\nA wealthy individual could have a large impact on the market. The way the buys and sells are setup is that people make a bid to buy or sell a certain number of bitcoin at a certain price. There are only so many bitcoin listed on the market. If someone wanted to buy 100,000 bitcoin, they would not be able to buy that many at the current market rate. They would have to buy some of those bitcoin from sellers that list their price at higher than the current market rate. This would in turn bring the rate up. A single exchange might not be able to handle that many bitcoin. The wealthy individual would be better off buying 10,000 bitcoin from each of the major exchanges. Further, they would be better of buying a percentage of these bitcoin each day over a longer period of time. However, they would risk that the price goes into a temporary bubble or a longer term increase in price. There would need to be a carefully planned entry into the market for these individuals to get a maximum amount of bitcoin for the most minimal price possible. There would be no perfect solution for this. It is a gamble on the unknown of the market.\r\n\r\n<b>High Prices</b>\r\n\r\nThe high price of bitcoin are making it so average people will not buy or use Bitcoin. The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. Once more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase. Once the value of the market increases, bitcoin will have a higher price tag. The price will find an equilibrium between this and several other factors. The price to mine a bitcoin will be factored into the price. Why would someone pay $400 for a bitcoin when they can mine one for $300 or less? The price to mine a bitcoin has been decreasing. This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine. The halving of the block reward that is predicted for around 2016 will make for a price increase of a possible factor of 2. Moore’s law suggests that computing power on a processor doubles every two years. For the ASICs that mine bitcoin, they have doubled every 6 months. This will make it cheaper and cheaper to mine bitcoin until around 2016. However, if the demand for bitcoin increases to a number larger than what the miners are generating and selling, then current bitcoin holders will sell their holding or the price will rise. Buyers will have to be willing to spend the higher amount of cash for a bitcoin or wait for someone to sell at a lower price. Some people depend on selling their bitcoin to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to buy bitcoin. All of these factors will make for a natural market. There could be short-lived crashes and bubbles, but I think the price will stay at around the price of mining with the supply &amp; demand also factored into the equation.\r\n\r\n<b>Hot Commodity</b>\r\n\r\nPeople will want to get into Bitcoin.

The psychological effect of 1 bitcoin is going to have an impact on the price of a bitcoin since there are only 14 million now and there will never be more than 21 million.

Investment firms are hiring people specializing in Bitcoin. They will be pitching Bitcoin to investors that have large quantities of money. Some of them will want to buy hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of bitcoin or more.

The way the buys and sells are setup is that people make a bid to buy or sell a certain number of bitcoin at a certain price. There are only so many bitcoins listed on the market. If someone wanted to buy 10,000 bitcoins, then they would not be able to buy that many at the current market rates.

The market is extremely volatile! There would need to be a carefully planned entry into the market for these individuals to get a maximum amount of bitcoin for the most minimal price possible. There would be no perfect solution for this. It is a gamble on the unknown of the market.\n\n<b>High Prices</b>\n\nThe high price of bitcoins are making it so average people will not buy or use Bitcoin. The prices need to come down so that people will buy them and use them. The actual price is irrelevant to their use since it is interchangeable with the USD. There are currently only 13.8 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million. There are 8 digits on the left of the dot and 8 digits on the right: \"13,800,000.12345678\". There is plenty of divisibility here. The high prices have a psychological effect on people in both directions - some people like the fact that the price of a single bitcoin is higher rather than there being 13 trillion bitcoins and there only ever being 21 trillion bitcoin. If the dot was shifted to the left 6 places like this 13,800,000,000,000.12 then, it would be fundamentally the same. Some people would prefer this for purely psychological reason.\n\nOnce more people use Bitcoin, then the value of the market will increase. Once the value of the market increases, bitcoins will have a higher price tag. The price will find an equilibrium between this and an uncountable (maybe countable) number of other factors. The price to mine a bitcoin will be factored into the price. Why would someone pay $400 for a bitcoin when they can mine one for $300 or less? The price to mine a bitcoin has been decreasing. This decrease will hit a critical point and then start getting more expensive to mine.

Some people depend on selling their bitcoins to pay their bills, so they can’t wait forever to sell - they are forced to sell at low prices.

If they choose to pay in Bitcoin, they could be shown the expenses that are saved and it can range from 50% for micro-purchases down to just a couple percent for larger purchases.','Bitcoin Micro-payments','','inherit','open','open','','62-revision-v1','','','2015-01-21 03:46:05','2015-01-21 03:46:05','',62,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=63',0,'revision','',0),(64,1,'2015-01-21 09:01:03','2015-01-21 09:01:03','<a href=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe use of physical money will be replaced by digital currencies. You might ask: \"What are we going to do with all of the old paper currencies?\" Well, we could certainly start building financial museums and someday bring our grandchildren there telling them: \"this is what we used to use when we were young\". Will it be just Bitcoin in the future? Absolutely not! The USD is almost a digital money already. Most transactions are done with credit cards or bank wires, but Bitcoin will have its role to play in the world. The USD is mostly just digits on a screen, anyhow - they are very similar, but Bitcoin has a lot of useful features that the USD does not have. It is possible that the USD will convert to a model that is more similar to Bitcoin, but that would be difficult to accomplish considering the foundations of our financial infrastructure was built on the current properties of the USD. If the USD acquires all the features that Bitcoins has, which it won\'t, will Bitcoin still have a role to play? Yes, I would say - Bitcoin is an extremely powerful <a title=\"Electronic Financial Instruments\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126\">financial instrument</a> that is <a title=\"Bitcoin is Programmable Money\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45\">easily programmable</a>!\r\n\r\nThe current owners of the physical money are not going to need to trade in their old bills. It would be wise for people to diversify their assets in case if the price of a bitcoin rises significantly compared to the USD.\r\n\r\nWill Bitcoin be one of the worlds\' currencies? It absolutely will be - it already has! The real question is: \"how large of a fraction of the pie of currencies will Bitcoin become?\"  Currently, most transactions with the USD and other fiat currencies are already digital. There is not actual physical cash that exists for all of the money that is out there. When someone gets a loan from the bank, they are lending out money that is in their accounts that belong to other people. So, do the people that have the money in their bank accounts also have that money, too? Does the account holder have $100,000 in the bank even though the bank lent that $100,000 to a home owner? That is $200,000 worth of money but only $100,000 in cash actually exists. Banks are required to hold 15% of the \"money\" as physical \"cash\". The rest is insured by the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/\">FDIC</a> (up to a certain amount) if account holders need their cash but the bank does not have it. There is no FDIC insurance for a Bitcoin wallet, but there are exchanges that offer private insurance on their accounts such as <a href=\"http://www.circle.com/\">Circle</a> and <a href=\"http://xapo.com/\">Xapo</a>.\r\n\r\nBank account holders are in fact lending their money to people that are holding debt to the bank. The account holders sometimes get some small amount of interest for the money in their bank accounts - it is not significant; it won\'t keep up with inflation. On top of the potential interest, the banks provide services in exchange for the bank holders\' cash. What would happen if a large number of people went to their banks and took out all of their money? The banks would not have enough. The FDIC insures the accounts so they have to send the money to the banks so they can give them to the account holders. If this happened rapidly, the FDIC would have to get the treasury to print a lot of money to payback the account holders. The people with debt to the bank would owe the bank and the FDIC the money on their loan. The home owner might or might not have a lot of wealth if they have a mortgage on their home. Homes would go way up in USD value since there is more money in circulation - most of them will have fixed rate interest.  The homeowners would benefit because there home would be worth more than what they owe on it but people holding actual money would be hurt because of the inflation.\r\n\r\nHow much would a large influx of investors buying bitcoins affect the financial system? The people that previously had the bitcoins and sold them to the people that took the money out of their banks to buy bitcoins will have a large portion of USD and possibly they will keep a significant portion of these bitcoins. This will potentially displace some of the funds from the banks and their other investments. Most of the USD will end up back in the banks which will, in turn, lend them out and the cycle will continue. Even if Bitcoin went mainstream, it will not cause a financial crisis; it will only open up more opportunity and cause the existing financial infrastructure to be more efficient and competitive. It may cause some obsolete services to go away.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. This will cause the Bitcoin to rise against the USD and it will transfer wealth to Bitcoin holders. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to mostly maintain the current distribution of wealth. Bitcoin has a long way to go to become relevant, but it is <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">growing rapidly</a>. There will be quite a few new millionaires and billionaires if Bitcoin goes mainstream. Bitcoin technology just might be the world\'s next largest international financial system that is widely recognized. Gold is an example of an international transaction system, but it is for the museums &amp; collectors now; it is impractical to use it for transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Receipts of gold\" was the next international transaction system - these receipts were called dollars, but then the dollars got detached from Gold. They then started making receipts for the dollar and transacted the receipts instead of transacting physical dollars - those were checks. They then created the Internet and could send digital receipts of the physical dollars - those were wire transfers and credit/debit cards. The current system is a mixture of  dollars, receipts of dollars and digital receipts of dollars. It is easy to exchange the digital receipts of dollars. Bitcoin is superior to digital receipts of dollars since it is self-contained. There has to be a lot of trust built between the parties when utilizing the current financial model since digital receipts of dollars are worthless unless if they are honored. With Bitcoin, this trust is not needed; once the transaction is complete, the wealth transfer has been honored and it can\'t be reversed. The Bitcoin system enforces integrity: money can only be sent from a wallet if a private key is provided. There is no need for an inefficient central authority to guarantee the integrity of transactions; Bitcoin transactions can be made almost instantly with absolute certainty.','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-replacing-physical-currencies','','http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45','2015-02-02 00:22:46','2015-02-02 00:22:46','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=64',0,'post','',0),(65,1,'2015-01-21 05:45:48','2015-01-21 05:45:48','','replacingbitcoinusd','','inherit','open','open','','replacingbitcoinusd','','','2015-01-21 05:45:48','2015-01-21 05:45:48','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif',0,'attachment','image/gif',0),(66,1,'2015-01-21 09:01:03','2015-01-21 09:01:03','<a href=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe use of physical money will be replaced by digital currencies. What are we going to do with all of the old paper currencies? Well, we could certainly start building financial museums.

What happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. There will be a lot of transfer of wealth and money moving around. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to maintain some of the current distribution of wealth.

The system enforces transactions and the Bitcoin system is 15,000 times more powerful than the world\'s top 500 supercomputers combined. A transaction can be sent and received with 100% guarantees as long as the Bitcoin system maintains stable. With it\'s extraordinary computing powers, the system will maintain for the foreseeable future and only grow stronger every year. This rate will accelerate also so we will be able to say that it will grow stronger every month and then every week and then every day. We will be able to calculate its growth by the hour. I\'m not talking about the USD price of bitcoins, I am talking about all the dynamics of the system.<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\">\r\n</a>','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','inherit','open','open','','64-revision-v1','','','2015-01-21 09:01:03','2015-01-21 09:01:03','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=66',0,'revision','',0),(67,1,'2015-01-27 08:54:52','2015-01-27 08:54:52','&nbsp;\n\n<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\n\nCredit cards are a pull technology. That is, when you go to purchase a service or product, you are giving your credit card and identification information and then they make a request for funds to your credit card company. The credit card company then authorizes the transaction resulting in the <i>pull transaction</i>. The company and anybody else can make this pull if they have your credit card information With bitcoin, you are sending money to the merchant directly. They don’t even have to authorize you to send them money. This is called a <i>push transaction</i>.\n\n<strong>Irreversible Transactions</strong>\n\nOnce you send bitcoins to an address, there is no undoing this - it is an irreversible transaction. With credit cards and ACH, there is a wait period before the money is sent. Also, the money can only sent to merchants that have shared all of their information with the bank or credit card company. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, then the merchant will not receive the funds from the credit card company. The merchant, in turn, makes up for these losses by raising there prices. The consumer ends up paying for this. The credit card companies also advertise that they offer fraud protection, but it is really the merchant that is being forced to offer the fraud protection.\n\n<b>Centralization vs Decentralization</b>\n\nThere will have to be a balance between centralization and decentralization. Pure centralization would mean there is one large organization that controls everything. Pure decentralization would mean that each person contributes nearly an equal amount of effort to the system. There must be a balance between these two. We can’t go too far in  either direction or we won’t progress with technology. If we start heading in one direction, a revolutionary product will come out that will bring it back in the other direction. Look back at the mainframes - they were a centralized computer system where dumb terminals would connect to them. Then, we switched towards decentralization by having all the processing power in each individual device. More recently, we have gone back in the direction of centralization with cloud services. Bitcoin is a revolutionary service that is leaning towards decentralization - anybody can have a bank on their own computer. In the end, there will be computation going on everywhere - centralized and decentralized.\n\n<b>Risky Owning Lots of Bitcoin</b>\n\nIt is necessary to keep hard copies of large quantities of bitcoins in fire proof safes or in an insured account - otherwise it is a risk and precautions need to be taken. Businesses surrounding safe bitcoin storage are arising. If bitcoins are not stored very carefully, they could be corrupted, lost or stolen. There have been countless tales of people losing bitcoins by computer crashes or having them stolen by hackers. $500,000,000.00, at the time of the theft, were stolen from customers on Mt. Gox.\n\nThe problem of safely storing large amounts of bitcoin will stop some investors from jumping on board right away. They will wait for an easy to understand and secure solution. They want their accounts to be insured by the FDIC. These services are being launched in Q1 2015. There is a market for professionals to advise wealthy individuals in purchasing bitcoin for their investment portfolio and this market will grow exponentially.\n\nIt is very dangerous to hold a large amount of cash since it can be lost or stolen. For Credit Cards, they pass the fraud expenses onto the businesses and customers. The loss is distributed more in CC - with bitcoin, it is more easy for an individual to get targeted and lose a lot. It would be a good general rule that if you have a large sum of bitcoins, then you better know exactly what you are doing or hire someone that knows what they are doing. And, make sure you trust the person that you hire - it would be easy for them to steal your bitcoins. Those bitcoins are almost certainly gone forever.\n\n<b>Banking for All</b>\n\nA high school student will have the power to run his or her own bank. A high school student from a 3rd world country will have the ability to run his or her own bank. 2/3’s of the worlds population does not have access to banking right now. Most of them have or will have mobile phones with internet access. They will be able to use Bitcoin and get access to the same banking systems that the rest of the world. They will be able to make orders for deliveries of items which otherwise might be more difficult.\n\nIn the not too future, drones will be able to deliver items to places around the world. This is not going to happen for many years, but large companies are currently working on drones that deliver items to people’s doorsteps. If this method of delivering goods proves successful, which it will, then drone development will grow exponentially and we will have drones that can deliver anything, anywhere at anytime. Since Bitcoin can be easily used by anyone, anywhere, at any time and for any amount of money, it will align well with an international drone delivery system.\n\nSpaceX and Facebook have been looking to create satellites that will allow everybody on the planet to get on the internet. They will be providing cheap mobile phones for little to no costs. Facebook will be able to monetize the traffic from all the new users, so they have an incentive to move fast on this venture. These new people on the web will probably all be using Bitcoin for their financial needs - it is an international digital currency that allows any two parties anywhere on the planet to immediately exchange wealth for nearly free. I should say free since the costs will be absorbed by 3rd party apps that will monetize the traffic with advertisements.\n\nHistory has never allowed for such a huge leap in financial internationalization before. Gold and the USD came the closest to allowing this so far; Bitcoin is the next chapter in this process. There has already been a confirmed transaction from somebody from North Korea. It is rare and highly illegal for residents of North Korea to make financial contact with anyone outside the country.\n\n<b>Getting People on Board</b>\n\nThe biggest hurdle right now is getting people on board. Bitcoin has a bad name and it sounds like it is from a cartoon. People that never heard about Bitcoin before usually laugh when I try to explain it to them. One way to get people on board is by giving free and/or cheap bitcoins in order to get people to become familiar with the name Bitcoin and build trust in the Bitcoin system. For the average person, a very small amount, maybe $1, should be seeded to individuals that otherwise would not get into Bitcoin. For the wealthy people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. The bitcoins need to be re-distributed from the early adopters to a larger population in order to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream. The early adopters will still benefit because the value of the entire Bitcoin network goes up for each new person that starts using Bitcoin.

For the wealth people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. This would be bad for the early adopters but good to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream.\r\n\r\n<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. A system called Ripple might be able to accomplish this. For Bitcoin to succeed, there will need to be some 3rd party agency that offers services similar to credit cards. People want a spending limit of money that they can pay back by the end of the next 30 day billing cycle just like they do with credit cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted lie TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.

If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire value of bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction value with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were valued at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. I know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 10 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 08:24:11','2015-01-23 08:24:11','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=71',0,'revision','',0),(72,1,'2015-01-23 08:24:47','2015-01-23 08:24:47','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\" alt=\"Server_01_Black\" width=\"400\" height=\"71\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Rewards</b>\r\n\r\nCurrently, miners are getting a reward for mining. This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime in 2017. This keeps getting cut in half every four years until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. There is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out how much a bitcoin is worth. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. Who could have imagined something like this even 20 years ago? I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there. I use it as my little hobby/work room and it is free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore because of the costs. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoin until they, hopefully, reach higher levels. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. The only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? But, it creates the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Miners Selling Cloud Contracts</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years. Since the ASICs for bitcoin mining came into existence over the past couple of years, the computational power for the bitcoin mining computers has doubled every 6 months and it appears as though this doubling every 6 months will continue here on forward.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining Exchange</b>\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahertz, exahertz, zettahertz or yottahertz. Those are real words, too! petahertz means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahertz means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The network is currently around 300,000,000 hertz.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. It will mine, by contributing a certain number of gigahash per second. Providing these gigahash costs electricity. The mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor of difficulty that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. During price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 13,000 times higher than the world 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn’t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. However, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 13,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

The way that it is done is that a hash of a document gets stored at an address on the Block Chain. The hash and date is now stored on the Block Chain for all of eternity. A document could then be verified to have existed on the Block Chain at a future date. This would be good for copyright, wills, deeds, and similar. This would be similar to getting a document notarized. It will have a signature stating that the document existed at a certain date. Courts and other legal entities only accept notarized documents from a certified notary. It would be much easier and cheaper to get a document notarized on the Block Chain. It could then be sent over the internet without creating a printed out copy. That would be excellent for the environment since using electricity and computers is more efficient than paper. Think about how much effort is done to bring paper documents across the country. You could argue that an e-mail is also proof of existence. However, an e-mail is harder to verify and make publicly available. It is certainly not as secure of a method as using the Block Chain. E-mails can be erased from existence fairly easily. A transaction on the Block Chain will never be erased.\n\nHow would using the Block Chain for this affect the price of a bitcoin? I would argue that the more valuable the Block Chain is, the more secure it would become. And, the more secure that it would become, then everything that the Block Chain is used for that is useful would become more valuable. Miners secure the network and receive bitcoin as a reward. If bitcoins are not valuable, miners will not secure the network. The more valuable bitcoins and the Bitcoin network is, then the higher the price of a bitcoin.\n\nAny parties that have an interest in the Block Chain or bitcoins or any technology that utilizes Bitoin will have vested much and would support the system - they would not let it fail. If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will attempt to that in order to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The Block Chain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for encrypted data to be sent over an un-encrypted network. \n\nBitcoin is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s. If someone can have an immutable proof of existence that the whole world can verify, that is huge! Using the Block Chain for this very task is extremely convenient!  I don\'t think Bitcoin or Block Chain will ever go away - it will exist as a historical artifact even after we stop using it. By the time it is obsolete, the human race will have at least inhabited several galaxies. Even then, it may still be useful. It may be one of the longest running and widely used currency, but we can\'t say for certainty just yet. We will have to wait and find out. I would recommend buying a few bitcoins just in case if Bitcoin and the Block Chain take off.','Proof of Existence','','inherit','open','open','','21-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-26 02:03:21','2015-01-26 02:03:21','',21,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=73',0,'revision','',0),(74,1,'2015-01-23 08:50:29','2015-01-23 08:50:29','[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"387\"]<img class=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg\" alt=\"Descartes\" width=\"387\" height=\"575\" /> I Think Therefore I Am[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe blockchain can be used to prove that a document existed at a certain date.

Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.\n\nWith the liquidity of bitcoins and the continued mining, I\'m not sure it is going to skyrocket too high. Most companies just sell the bitcoins as soon as they receive them. Maybe that will change if the price keeps going up, but it is too much of a gamble for a large company to hold onto the bitcoins unless if they have plenty of cash reserves to cover the potential drop in the price of bitcoins. I think the cost to mine will stay aligned with the price because why would someone pay more for bitcoins when they can pay less to mine them and the other way around, so the two should stay pretty close together. And, there is only so much hashing power being created every month so I\'.\n\nAnd, the blockchain tech is really about proof of existence - a hash of a document can be stored on the blockchain to prove that it existed at a certain time. The more valuable the documents that get put on the blockchain, then the hashing needs to be greater to ensure that they are secure and that will bring up the value. I don\'t see it happening that quickly, but I might be very wrong. A huge surge of newcomers coming in could increase the demand so much higher than the supply, that the price will have no choice but to go up. Mining hardware would be out of stock if that happened since it would technically be cheaper to mine it than to buy it.

Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013. If Bitcoin could grab even 1% of the market, then the price will should go up much higher than it is.\r\n\r\nFor large organizations or individuals that want to trade a billion or more dollars worth of bitcoins, then they would either have to buy about a quarter of all bitcoins in circulation at the current rate. If wealthy individuals wanted to own bitcoins to transfer or store wealth, then the price would have to go up. I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.\r\n\r\nWith the liquidity of bitcoins and the continued mining, I\'m not sure it is going to skyrocket too high. Most companies just sell the bitcoins as soon as they receive them. Maybe that will change if the price keeps going up, but it is too much of a gamble for a large company to hold onto the bitcoins unless if they have plenty of cash reserves to cover the potential drop in the price of bitcoins. I think the cost to mine will stay aligned with the price because why would someone pay more for bitcoins when they can pay less to mine them and the other way around, so the two should stay pretty close together. And, there is only so much hashing power being created every month so I\'m not 100% sure it will valued that much more.\r\n\r\nAnd, the blockchain tech is really about proof of existence - a hash of a document can be stored on the blockchain to prove that it existed at a certain time. The more valuable the documents that get put on the blockchain, then the hashing needs to be greater to ensure that they are secure and that will bring up the value. I don\'t see it happening that quickly, but I might be very wrong. A huge surge of newcomers coming in could increase the demand so much higher than the supply, that the price will have no choice but to go up. Mining hardware would be out of stock if that happened since it would technically be cheaper to mine it than to buy it. It will be an interesting ride watching all the variables interacting with each other.','What Can Bitcoins Be Valued At','','inherit','open','open','','9-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 10:27:52','2015-01-23 10:27:52','',9,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=76',0,'revision','',0),(77,1,'2015-01-26 23:24:29','2015-01-26 23:24:29','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hool_face_vector.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-78\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 30px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hool_face_vector.gif\" alt=\"hool_face_vector\" width=\"198\" height=\"283\" /></a>\n\n<b>Terrorists Use Bitcoin</b>\n\nTerrorists use smartphones. Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use it to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people.\n\nBitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain backwards and forward. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. They could track down a network of criminals &amp; terrorists.\n\nI’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this as an excuse to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have to compete besides lowering their rates for their services. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams - very large salaries &amp; bonuses depend on it! If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well ban airplanes since terrorists use them to crash into buildings. If a government bans Bitcoin with that logic, then they ought to start making it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to commit terrorism. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. These related arguments against Bitcoin does not hold up if using reasonable logic.\n\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\n\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins were created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. The anonymity is that the addresses are not associated to anybody. Once the addresses are associated to individuals, then their is no anonymity. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nOnce a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person could possibly be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. It is possible that the bitcoins were legally obtained. It would be wise to keep detailed documentation if you are planning on doing a lot of business with bitcoins. Personally, I would recommend to only purchase bitcoins from a reputable source. If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government.\n\nA court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\n\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities.

It provides very valuable services. Bitcoin is not being sold either. The term \"bitcoins\" is a store of value on the Bitcoin network. This store of value can be sent or received by anybody else with a wallet on the Bitcoin network. This transfer of value is the same service that the major credit card companies provide. Yet, Bitcoin provides the service for nearly free or potentially free. Credit card companies charge huge fees to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Take a look at how much Western Union charges to transfer money from person A in one country  to person B from another country.\r\n\r\nThis would be like calling the internet a Ponzi scheme or calling email a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is a protocol. That means it is just a set of standard rules that a network must follow. The rest of the network can verify if any single node is not following the rules and not accept the work that they performed. Data center provide their processing power for a fee to businesses that need a website. E-mail is free for the end user because the companies that are paying for the hosting is also placing ads and making revenues from the users that way. Since Bitcoin is such a useful financial instrument, it can not be a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can’t be selling a useful product. Some people are calling Bitcoin one of the greatest inventions of all time comparing it to the likes of the telephone. To call it a Ponzi scheme is completely inaccurate since it provides so much for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy bitcoins, you are buying a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. The USD is a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. Gold used to be a good store of wealth and excellent to trade for goods and services. However, it is very inefficient to send gold back and forth between people. The US Dollar was a receipt of gold before they detached its value from gold. It was then set by how much money they print and what people can get with the money that they have. Some financial institutions provide services like Bitcoin does, but they charge a large amount of fees to use it. Even if Bitcoin is not successful, it will be a competitor to the current financial markets and force them to lower the prices or risk losing customers. The current institutions might try to make up for their losses by increasing their prices even more. This would, in turn, make more people try to find alternative sources. In the end, I think Bitcoin will be used around the globe and it will force the large financial institutions to lower their prices for their services. The financial institutions must adapt to meet the advancing technology that the human race is discovering. We are currently locked in an old system that a few wealthy individuals control. Bitcoin will free the world from the current monopoly and give the two out of three people on the planet banking that currently do not have it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 11:43:40','2015-01-23 11:43:40','',11,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=81',0,'revision','',0),(82,1,'2015-01-23 11:45:10','2015-01-23 11:45:10','','photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs','','inherit','open','open','','photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs','','','2015-01-23 11:45:10','2015-01-23 11:45:10','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(83,1,'2015-01-23 11:45:20','2015-01-23 11:45:20','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs\" width=\"550\" height=\"364\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI think the price of bitcoin is going to be hovering around the cost to mine a bitcoin for a while, but it will see some spikes and drops. It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy everyday to sustain the market. This is inflation. This is exactly what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half.The number of miners is growing. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it is growing. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. Also, the value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. There are fewer people that are willing to sell the bitcoin for prices any lower. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is huge.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. Once more people see that, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be a lot more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Currently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks, they don\'t want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed. There are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday. It will be the world\'s most valuable banking system. It is the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. It can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd parties that put advertisements in their free wallets that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 11:45:20','2015-01-23 11:45:20','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=83',0,'revision','',0),(84,1,'2015-01-23 12:12:26','2015-01-23 12:12:26','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52\" style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"introducingbitcoinusd\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is a tool to move wealth from old financial institutions to a younger more tech savvy crowd.

The way that it could be done is that someone that has a document get a hash of it and place the hash at an address on the blockchain. The hash and date is now stored on the blockchain for all of eternity. A document could then be verified to have existed on the blockchain at a future date. This would be good for copyright, wills, deeds, and similar. This would be similar to getting a document notarized. It will have a signature stating that the document existed at a certain date. Courts and other legal entities only accept notarized documents from a certified notary. It would be much easier and cheaper to get a document notarized on the blockchain. It could then be sent over the internet without having ever have a printed out copy. That would be excellent for the environment since using electricity and computers is more efficient than paper. Think about how much effort is done to bring paper documents across the country. You could argue that an e-mail is also proof of existence. However, an e-mail is harder to verify and make publicly available. It is certainly not as secure of a method as using the blockchain. E-mails can be erased from existence fairly easily. A transaction on the blockchain will never be erased.\r\n\r\nHow would using the blockchain for this affect the price of a bitcoin? I would argue that the more valuable the blockchain is, the more secure it would become. And, the more secure that it would become, then everything that the blockchain is used for that is useful would become more valuable. Miners secure the network and receive bitcoin as a reward. If the bitcoin is not valuable, miners will not secure the network. Any parties that have an interest in the blockchain or bitcoins or any technology that utilizes Bitoin will have vested much and would support the system - they would not let it fail. If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will do that to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The blockchain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for non-encrypted data to be sent over the network. It is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s. If someone can have an unmalleable proof of existence that the whole world can verify, that is huge! Using the Blockchain for this very task is extremely convenient!  I don\'t think Bitcoin or blockchain will ever go away - it will exist as a historical artifact even after we stop using it. By the time it is obsolete, the human race will have at least inhabited several galaxies. Even then, it may still be useful. It may be one of the longest running and widely used currency, but we can\'t say for certainty just yet. We will have to wait and find out.','Proof of Existence','','inherit','open','open','','21-revision-v1','','','2015-01-23 13:01:09','2015-01-23 13:01:09','',21,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=86',0,'revision','',0),(87,1,'2015-01-23 14:19:00','2015-01-23 14:19:00','<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-88\" style=\"float: left; padding-right: 25px;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-2359962-robot-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Robot\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" />\n\n<b>Based on Computing Power</b>\n\nIt would be difficult to create a new crypto-currency that is as fair as bitcoin because if it did start getting big, the people that were in early will get rewarded more than that got in later on. The big miners would own a lot of the new coins and people with money could buy them. There would be no little guys. I don\'t think any of the alt-coins out right now are going to surpass Bitcoin. There are some interesting alt-coins where the processing is used to solve useful mathematical equations. A currency like Primecoin might get larger since the hashing algorithm also looks for prime numbers and those prime numbers are useful for scientist and engineers.\n\nA new system could not be based on pure randomness for each wallet because whoever has the most wallets would get the most coins. It will end up being a race for whoever has the most computing power because the person with the most computing power could create the most wallets. Bitcoin has a good lead on any new crypto-currency since it has had so much time to mature. Currently, the newcomers with the most hashing power will earn the biggest rewards. If a similar system came out now, then the few major miners would take a majority of the mining reward. It would be a monopoly on the system. It is good that there were some little guys that got in at the beginning of Bitcoin. It is still the beginning of Bitcoin, so there is plenty of room for late stage newcomers.\n\n<b>Proof of Work</b>\n\nProof of Work is the hashing that a miner does to show that a large investment was made to verify the transactions. It is a difficult math problem that needs to be solved by an ASIC. The rest of the nodes then validate the miners work. This is necessary because if there was no proof of work, then there would be bad nodes that would try to manipulate the system. This ensures that there will be no bad actors because it would be expensive to attempt and difficult to achieve. It is easy to verify that a miner did the correct work.\n\nHere is an alternative proof of work that might be effective: a node gains power through validating &amp; processing transactions. The more correct transactions that the node has  verified, the more power it has on the network. As soon as a powerful node is caught making an incorrect transaction, then they would lose power. The network would also correct the inaccurate transaction that the bad node might have attempted to change. The transactions would have to have a maximum of a single unit. This system is feasible and it is not so expensive to operate. If a system like this could verify transactions as Bitcoin does, then Bitcoin could be in trouble since it will take far less computing power. As there are more transactions on Bitcoin, an adaption to the protocol could be made to allow for miners to spend more computing power on validating and processing transactions instead of just hashing to prove they are doing work.\n\nBitcoin would be an ancestor system to any new ones. I think it will always be around. If a new methodology arises then Bitcoin could be adapted to follow it.\n\n<b>Unfair</b>\n\nA lot of people argue that it is unfair that the ownership of all the bitcoins is skewed towards such a small number of people. The miners that provided just a small amount of computing power at the beginning and held onto their bitcoins will have made an extremely large amount of money from a network that other miners are supporting. With the growing computing power that is needed, a newcomer has to provide thousands and thousands of times more hashing than the very first miners back in 2009-2012. With the maturity of bitcoin compared to any other crypto-currency, it would be hard to make another more fair currency. Whoever gets in on the next currency first will have more coins. If the algorithm was designed to not reward so many coins at the beginning, then that would make it more fair for people that come in later. With the price lowering as of early 2015, this should force some of the early adopters to sell some of their bitcoins to others that are interested in joining the market. However, the earliest adopters built the system. It wouldn\'t be here if it wasn\'t for them. Maybe they deserve the rewards.\n\nIn the long run, there will be some early adopters that might join the status of billionaire (USD). Currently, there are 1,645 billionaires in the world. There were 268 newcomers in 2014. There is plenty of room for a few more of them. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has over 1 million bitcoins. When the price of bitcoin surged to over $1,100, Satoshi’s worth was valued over $1 Billion. However, if he tried to sell them all for $1,1000 each or any price, the demand would fall and the price of the bitcoin would fall with it probably right down to $20. I don’t think bitcoin is going to shift the wealth of the world very much. Those early adopters would be better off slowly selling bitcoins over the years. If they sell too many, the price will plummet. If they hold onto them, the price should rise, but it will be lowered once they start to sell them. They will need to sell some of them to live a billionaire lifestyle. - not everybody accepts bitcoin as a payment. Even if they do accept bitcoin as a payment, then the bitcoin will be distributed more. Wealthy people will get their hands on their share of the bitcoin. They have the power to manipulate the bitcoin markets and get it from the early adopters for cheaper than what it will be worth in the future. In the long run, I think the bitcoin will end up mostly in the pockets of the existing rich people. And, it will create a lot of new wealthy people.\n\n<b>Advancement of Processing</b>\n\nBitcoin is speeding up the rate at which computation advances.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. I know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will be printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 5 years, but the price will go up eventually.

It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy in order to sustain the market so price don\'t rapidly decline. Bitcoin mining is inflation. This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half. The number of miners is growing. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. Also, the value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices as you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go down to less than $200 and fewer sell orders until near $400. There are fewer people that are willing to sell the bitcoin for prices any lower. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. Currently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them unless if they owned a significant amount of bitcoins or had stake in a 3rd party Bitcoin app. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed since it is a transfer of wealth and power. There are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. It can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-01-25 03:29:13','2015-01-25 03:29:13','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=96',0,'revision','',0),(97,1,'2015-01-25 05:38:22','2015-01-25 05:38:22','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cost-vs-value.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-98\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cost-vs-value.jpg\" alt=\"Cost-value graph on blackboard\" width=\"511\" height=\"391\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin network is not free - it costs money to run. It is a network of super-computers. The miners, which run the network, get paid with transactions fees and rewards for providing this valuable service. They are currently rewarded with 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes and the transactions - this is the cost of Bitcoin. When I say value, I am not talking about price. Price is how much a bitcoin costs and value is how well of a service Bitcoin offers. The inflation started off at 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes in 2009 when Bitcoin was first launched. This number gets cut in half every 4 years. This \"minting\" or \"mining\" of the bitcoins is inflationary in nature. Every 25 new bitcoins mined will make the rest of the bitcoins worth a little bit less. So, the holders of bitcoins are paying the high transaction fees right now. However, this cost is offset by new-comers buying the newly minted bitcoins, so the current bitcoin holders aren\'t taking 100% of the costs. The transaction fees are negligible right now but they will grow over time and should accumulate with the large quantity of transactions. Around 2140, Bitcoin will stop mining new bitcoins since it gets cut in half every 4 years. This is when the inflation stops. The price of bitcoins should be affected dramatically at the next halving scheduled to happen around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. The supply will be less and if the demand stays the same, then the price of the bitcoins will have to go up. Currently, the price staying high depends on the number of people entering the bitcoin purchasing market. It seems to be maintaining to some extent right now. The price is still around $250 per bitcoin at the time of this writing. The miners are able to sell their bitcoins. The $250 price seems low compared to the high of $1150, but the high was an artificial spike. The average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since the launch of the Bitcoin network. Some would argue that since the price of the current holders of bitcoins depends on new generations of buyers, then Bitcoin must be a pyramid scheme. However, it is not since the value of the services offered by Bitcoin, the blockchain, and bitcoins. And, the fact that the inflation steadily goes away. If the number of bitcoins generated instead doubled every 4 years instead of halving every 4 years then that would make it much more similar to a pyramid scheme.

If they have to buy up all the bitcoins to increase demand and raise the price, then they will do that to secure the digital proofs. The internet is very secure for sending encrypted and non-encrypted data from two points on the network. The blockchain is built into the internet and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. It allows for non-encrypted data to be sent over the network. It is a public ledger to verify certain transactions at certain dates. The implications of this are huge. This proof of existence will be important for information that will be online. When an individual or entity creates some digital content, they want proof that it is there’s.

It takes the responsibility to print and mint money away from the treasurer. It takes the 3rd parties out of transactions. It allows one user to send money directly to another user basically for free. This website will go over some of the basics of Bitcoin and then go deep into some of the more advanced topics. I will be discussing Bitcoin in relation to the USD and all other financial instruments.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is an international and decentralized network that contains a blockchain with stores of value in it at certain addresses. Just like the USD, Bitcoin provides for a mechanism to store wealth and to make trades. The blockchain contains all of the transactions between these addresses and so much more than that. A user of Bitcoin would need a password and private key to transfer funds from that address. Anybody can send money to the addresses on the Blockchain. The blockchain is also an open network where anybody willing to participate is allowed if they follow the rules. The Blockchain is very complicated and I am only going to give a brief overview of it here at this website.\r\n\r\nIn this website, I will write about some of the most important parts of Bitcoin. I will also give my personal opinion on Bitcoin and go over other peoples opinions. I will discuss everything and anything involving Bitcoin. If you have any topics that you would like me to write about that is related to Bitcoin, please leave a comment below! If I can respond in the comment, I will do that. If your inquiry deserves a full article, then I will write an article.','Introduction','','inherit','open','open','','4-revision-v1','','','2015-01-25 06:49:33','2015-01-25 06:49:33','',4,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=103',0,'revision','',0),(106,1,'2015-01-25 08:37:50','0000-00-00 00:00:00','[todo describe big sales 10,000+ coins etc... and how it would impact price, cause bear or bull, etc... usually don\'t happen because it is smarter to slowly buy or sell coins so a seller can make more or a buyer can get them for less.','Large Bitcoin Sells/Buys','','draft','open','open','','','','','2015-01-25 08:37:50','2015-01-25 08:37:50','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=106',0,'post','',0),(108,1,'2015-01-26 01:40:27','2015-01-26 01:40:27','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8473648-boss-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8473648-boss-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Boss\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBy no means can Bitcoin be labeled as a Ponzi scheme. It provides very valuable services. Bitcoin is not being sold either. The term \"bitcoins\" is a store of value on the Bitcoin network. This store of value can be sent or received by anybody else with a wallet on the Bitcoin network. This transfer of value is the same service that the major credit card companies provide. Yet, Bitcoin provides the service for nearly free or potentially free. Credit card companies charge huge fees to transfer wealth from one individual to another. Take a look at how much Western Union charges to transfer money from person A in one country  to person B from another country.\r\n\r\nThis would be like calling the internet a Ponzi scheme or calling email a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is a protocol. That means it is just a set of standard rules that a network must follow. The rest of the network can verify if any single node is not following the rules and not accept the work that they performed. Data center provide their processing power for a fee to businesses that need a website. E-mail is free for the end user because the companies that are paying for the hosting is also placing ads and making revenues from the users that way. Since Bitcoin is such a useful financial instrument, it can not be a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme can’t be selling a useful product. Some people are calling Bitcoin one of the greatest inventions of all time comparing it to the likes of the telephone. To call it a Ponzi scheme is completely inaccurate since it provides so much for nearly nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy bitcoins, you are buying a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. The USD is a tool to make trading goods and services more easily. Gold used to be a good store of wealth and excellent to trade for goods and services. However, it is very inefficient to send gold back and forth between people. The US Dollar was a receipt of gold before they detached its value from gold. It was then set by how much money they print and what people can get with the money that they have. Some financial institutions provide services like Bitcoin does, but they charge a large amount of fees to use it. Even if Bitcoin is not successful, it will be a competitor to the current financial markets and force them to lower the prices or risk losing customers. \r\n\r\nThe current institutions might try to make up for their losses by increasing their prices even more. This would, in turn, make more people try to find alternative sources. In the end, I think Bitcoin will be used around the globe and it will force the large financial institutions to lower their prices for their services. The financial institutions must adapt to meet the advancing technology that the human race is discovering. We are currently locked in an old system that a few wealthy individuals control. Bitcoin will free the world from the current monopoly and give the two out of three people on the planet banking that currently do not have it.','Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 01:40:27','2015-01-26 01:40:27','',11,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=108',0,'revision','',0),(109,1,'2015-01-26 01:42:50','2015-01-26 01:42:50','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-70\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Server_01_Black.gif\" alt=\"Server_01_Black\" width=\"400\" height=\"71\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Mine Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes if you would enjoy doing it as a hobby. It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing. \r\n\r\nI know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two <a title=\"AntMiner S5s\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=antminer%20s5&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=ezstbu-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=NIKVZOXLMVGP52ZI\">AntMiner S5s</a> because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will be printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 5 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and the adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 01:42:50','2015-01-26 01:42:50','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=109',0,'revision','',0),(110,1,'2015-01-26 01:50:06','2015-01-26 01:50:06','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-1378449-hand-pushing-comment-button-xs\" width=\"550\" height=\"364\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI think the price of a bitcoin is going to be hovering around the cost to mine a bitcoin for a while, but it will see some spikes and drops. It can be calculated how much it would cost to invest in mining bitcoin versus buying bitcoin. People with deep pockets will choose the cheapest of the two. Over 3600 new bitcoin get mined every day. At $250, that is nearly $1 million everyday of new bitcoins that people will need to buy in order to sustain the market so price don\'t rapidly decline. Bitcoin mining is inflation. This is also what the treasury does with the USD. With Bitcoin, this inflation is temporary. Every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that the miner earns gets cut in half. \r\n\r\nThe number of miners is growing at a rapid pace. There is an all time high of the hash rate right now and it constantly growing over time so every week it reaches another all time high. There are plenty of people that are buying bitcoin and saving them as a store of value. The value of the USD is growing so more bitcoin can be purchased for less. That might be partly a reason for the declines in 2014. There are plenty of people that want to buy bitcoin at lower prices. Currently, you can see many buy orders at the exchange that go about 25% down from the going rate. There are fewer sell orders until about 50% above going rate. So, more people are ready to buy then there are to sell as of the writing of this article. The technology and the computing power dedicated to bitcoin is already huge and it is growing at an exponential rate. This computing power will be directly proportional to the going rate. Over the long run, you can see that both the computer power and price have steadily grown since 2009.\r\n\r\nBitcoin will be used by the masses for many different purposes in the future. It is inevitable since the utility Bitcoin offers for near free will be able to fiercely compete with banks and credit card companies. Once more people see this truth, more people are going to want to buy and hold onto bitcoin as a store of wealth. This, in turn, could make the value of bitcoin go up. When will this happen? We can\'t say exactly, but it could take several years or several months. There are only about 13.8 million bitcoin available right now and there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. The network behind bitcoin will be comparably more powerful than some banks holding hundreds of billions as a store of wealth. Since there is no mining at banks, it is like comparing apples and oranges. \r\n\r\nCurrently, all bitcoin is worth about $4 billion. I think it will be worth hundreds of billions in the not too distant future. That being said, multiply the $250 by about 25 if all of bitcoin would be worth $100 billion. A lot of very rich people don\'t want to buy bitcoins right now because it would be like funding the competitors of their current investments. Someone that is well vested into banking stocks will not want to see bitcoin take 10% of the market. That would be a loss for them unless if they owned a significant amount of bitcoins or had stake in a 3rd party Bitcoin app. There are a lot of people that don\'t want bitcoin to succeed since it is a transfer of wealth and power. \r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of semi-rich and powerful people that do want to see bitcoin succeed. It will be used to send money around the world for free without having to give the banks a cut in the transfer. It will be used as simply a store of wealth. It will be used to safely make small purchases online so you don\'t have to worry about entering your credit card information for a $0.99 purchase at a random website in China or Argentina. It has so many more uses than I have mentioned. Many books can be written about just a fraction of the possibilities. Bitcoin will be worth a lot someday - it might be the world\'s most valuable banking system someday. It might be the biggest international trade network that has ever existed. \r\n\r\nBitcoin can be compared to gold or modern currencies with free banking services attached to it. I say free services because the costs of transactions will be offset from the user just like the costs of e-mailing are not directly billed to the user; the costs of using Bitcoin will be taken care of by 3rd party apps that put advertisements in the free services that they provide. 3rd parties will give Bitcoin credit lines to individuals and entities that have good credit. There will be Bitcoin Credit Reporting Agencies (BCRA\'s) that have information just like the current Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA\'s). The BCRA\'s will be attached to transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain.','Bitcoin Commentary','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 01:50:06','2015-01-26 01:50:06','',17,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=110',0,'revision','',0),(111,1,'2015-01-26 01:50:29','2015-01-26 01:50:29','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe value of bitcoins could fall to a low level if there are not a lot of people that used it and they only used it for small transactions. If they were worth $1 each, then the maximum transaction would be about $14 Million and that is if they were all used in a single transaction. That is not possible, because many different people own bitcoins. In international trade, $14,000,000 is a very small amount. Currently, $35,000,000 trades hands in bitcoins every day. They would at least have to be worth $2.50 each to maintain that transaction volume. Not all bitcoins get traded every day. The entire value of bitcoins is about $3,500,000,000. Only a small fraction of the bitcoins trade hands every day. A lower limit on the price of bitcoins would have to be enough to support the daily transaction value with the percentage of bitcoins being traded factored in. If they were valued at $1,000.00 each, then all bitcoins combined would be worth $14 Billion. Trading in foreign exchange markets averaged <a title=\"$5.4 trillion\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 trillion</a> per day in April 2013.

I don’t think it is unlikely for the price of bitcoins to go back up near $1,000 in the not too distant future based on how much trade happens every day in the international community and how much in transaction fees people could save.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure if using the $5,300,000,000,000 is correct or it includes extra items that should not be compared to exchanging bitcoins without further analysis. Also, the actual number might be higher because this may not include every single trade between every single person on the planet in a given day. There is no way to record that as of now. Possibly in the future, all transactions on our planet would have to be recorded by some international law or treaty. That would be hard to control unless if all transactions had to be done electronically and linked to an identity.\r\n\r\nWith the liquidity of bitcoins and the continued mining, I\'m not sure it is going to skyrocket too high. Most companies just sell the bitcoins as soon as they receive them. Maybe that will change if the price keeps going up, but it is too much of a gamble for a large company to hold onto the bitcoins unless if they have plenty of cash reserves to cover the potential drop in the price of bitcoins. I think the cost to mine will stay aligned with the price because why would someone pay more for bitcoins when they can pay less to mine them and the other way around, so the two should stay pretty close together. And, there is only so much hashing power being created every month so I\'m not 100% sure it will valued that much more.\r\n\r\nAnd, the blockchain tech is really about proof of existence - a hash of a document can be stored on the blockchain to prove that it existed at a certain time.

I don\'t see it happening that quickly, but I might be very wrong. A huge surge of newcomers coming in could increase the demand so much higher than the supply, that the price will have no choice but to go up.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. This process of halving continues until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. However, there is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market. Learn more about the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">Costs of Bitcoin</a> paid through inflation and transaction fees.\n\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\n\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9\">price of a bitcoin</a>. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. This is about a half a watt of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially. I would not be surprised to see rates of 0.01 W/GH/s in a few years from now. Moore\'s law states that processing power doubles every 18 months - the processing power for ASIC miners for Bitcoin doubles every 6 months. This time for doubling is shrinking. We could see doubling of processing power every month at some point in the future. Most people predicted that Moore\'s law would slow down, but this might not be the case. However, there are some physical limitations in our universe that will prevent us from further increasing processing power. I would say the most extreme limitation is the speed of light.\n\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\n\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? It does create the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing surrounding Bitcoin mining. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\n\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\n\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi-attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there during the winter months. I use it as my little hobby/work room and the miners now provide, basically, free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoins until they, hopefully, reach much higher prices. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. I did buy them with a credit card on a 0% APR promotion so I would not have been able to purchase the bitcoins directly with my credit card as I can with the mining hardware. I will also be able to, hopefully, sell the miners in May when the warm weather approaches. This makes mining profitable for my specific case. \n\nTypically, the only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\n\n<b>Cloud Mining & Exchanges</b>\n\nMiners can potentially make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that Moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years.\n\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\n\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\n\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahash, exahash, zettahash or yottahash. Those are real words, too! petahash means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahash means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\n\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\n\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. \n\nThe mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. \n\nDuring price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 15,000 times higher than the world\'s 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn\'t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. \n\nHowever, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\n\nIt is the duty of nations to protect its\' citizens assets and interests. Citizens from many nations have vested interest in Bitcoin. An attack on the Bitcoin network by individuals will be regarded as an act of terrorism against all the countries who have citizens that are vested in Bitcoin. Nations would be obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. If a nation attacke\n\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\n\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 13,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin. When the price of bitcoin drops, old mining equipment becomes unprofitable and thus the operators turn it off. This in turn, makes it more profitable for the newer mining equipment since there is less competition. The rewards are assigned to the miners based on how much processing power they supply. There is a difficulty factor that can go up or down based on how much mining power there has been in the last couple of weeks. When the price of bitcoin falls, the miners make less money and the old equipment gets removed from the market. The efficient miners with the new equipment remain profitable. This process will help the mining market progress. When bitcoin price raises, people invest making faster and more efficient mining equipment. \r\n\r\nThe mining equipment that uses the least amount of electricity will make the most profits as long as the price of building hardware to get the low electricity outweighs the profit. There is an equilibrium between all of these factors where the only outcome will be a balance between the hash rate, difficulty and price. The difficulty is a factor that makes the network as secure as possible with the amount of processing power that is currently possible. The more processing power that is contributed to the Bitcoin network, then the more secure it is. This balance should make minor spikes and drops in the hash rate over time. \r\n\r\nDuring price drops, there will be less hashing and the network will be less secure, but the network will be worth less. It will always remain unprofitable for someone to attack the network. Even if the hashing power drops, then the intruders could not make a profit at the current rate of the bitcoin. It is not a trivial task to intrude on the network. It would take a significant amount of resources that nobody currently has. Someone would need the processing power of 15,000 times higher than the world\'s 500 supercomputers combined. And, if they did accomplish this, then the price of bitcoins would be worthless anyhow, so they wouldn\'t make any gains. If a very powerful entity or group of entities could make huge profits by shutting down the Bitcoin networks, then it would be profitable for them. \r\n\r\nHowever, that would cause a fork and the developers would make efforts to stop the counter network from intruding on the newly created network. The act of taking down the Bitcoin network would be an act of cyber warfare. People from many nations have their wealth stored in Bitcoin. It is the duty of nations to protect its’ citizens from wide scale attacks. It would be the same as if a nation attacked the computer networks of businesses in a nation. The attacked nation would have the right to respond militarily. I think in the distant future, an effective attack on the Bitcoin network would be construed as an act of war against many nations. There will be terrorists and criminals that could attempt to attack the network, but that would be the same as terrorists and criminals attacked a bank. The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals. Terrorists and criminals would never acquire the resources to launch an effective attack against the Bitcoin network. They would probably be able to more easily steal or buy a nuclear bomb from a nation.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of nations to protect its\' citizens assets and interests. Citizens from many nations have vested interest in Bitcoin. An attack on the Bitcoin network by individuals will be regarded as an act of terrorism against all the countries who have citizens that are vested in Bitcoin. Nations would be obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. If a nation attacked the Bitcoin network, it will be viewed as an act of cyber-warfare against many nations at once. People argue that the Bitcoin can\'t be legitimate because there is no nation that backs it. However, there are many nations that back it. It already has more backing by more nations than any other currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole. Portable homes that generate profits from the heat they generate could be airlifted to places in the north and south pole. There could be communities built around technology. And, even further craziness, this could lead to advancements in space travel and colonizing other planets such as mars. Heating would be expensive on mars. Maybe some complex mathematical models can be simulated with the technology that is created as a result of Bitcoin. I’m not claiming that this wouldn\'t happen anyways, but Bitcoin is going to speed up the process. There is evidence that you can see by measuring the rate at which processing power grows. The amount of processing power on a chip typically doubles every two years. The processing power on Bitcoin mining power doubles every 6 months. The Bitcoin network has more 15,000 times more processing power than the world\'s 500 most powerful supercomputers combined. That is extremely impressive and it is something that our has not seen before! These chips are very specific purpose for Bitcoin mining, but the advancements in technology will help to solve complex mathematical models.

This started at 50 bitcoin and halves every 4 years. It is currently at 25 and should fall to 12.5 sometime around the end of 2016 or beginning of 2017. This process of halving continues until there are about 21 million bitcoin in existence. After that, miners do not get rewarded with blocks for mining. However, there is a transaction fee built into the system. It is currently very low since the miners get rewarded with new bitcoin instead of the transaction fees. In the future, transactions are going to cost money. This cost will have to be competitive with other services in the market. Learn more about the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">Costs of Bitcoin</a> paid through inflation and transaction fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Energy Costs</b>\r\n\r\nThe cost of energy to mine coins will be factored into the equation to figure out the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=9\">price of a bitcoin</a>. The amount of energy to provide the equivalent amount of computer power decreases over time. For example, the AntMiner S1 has a Power efficiency of 2 W/GH/s on wall. That is, it costs 2 watts of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. The AntMiner S5 has a Power Efficiency of 0.51 W/GH/s. This is about a half a watt of power to process 1 gigahash in one second. Another word for W/GH/s would be a Joule. Over time, we will use lesser and lesser energy to provide the same amount of processing power. This fact makes it so the costs to maintain the Bitcoin network do not grow exponentially. I would not be surprised to see rates of 0.01 W/GH/s in a few years from now. Moore\'s law states that processing power doubles every 18 months - the processing power for ASIC miners for Bitcoin doubles every 6 months. This time for doubling is shrinking. We could see doubling of processing power every month at some point in the future. Most people predicted that Moore\'s law would slow down, but this might not be the case. However, there are some physical limitations in our universe that will prevent us from further increasing processing power. I would say the most extreme limitation is the speed of light.\r\n\r\n<b>Processing Bitcoin a Waste of Energy</b>\r\n\r\nDoes all the processing and effort done by the miners just waste resources? It does create the market for the software &amp; hardware jobs in engineering and manufacturing surrounding Bitcoin mining. The results from the work that mining accomplishes is more valuable than what the mining costs. This work would be done by expensive bankers if it was not done by the computer hardware. Computers can solve problems more efficiently than people in a lot of cases. Financing may well be one of them. Obviously, individuals will need to have control over the system and they will. The energy &amp; resources consumed in the Bitcoin network is much less than the energy &amp; resources that are consumed with the old-fashioned method of banking &amp; finances. This energy can be reused as a method of heat in cold climates. I personally use miners to heat an addition to my home.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Causes Heat</b>\r\n\r\nThis heat needs to be put to use for it to be efficient. It would be useful in colder parts of the world. A mining community could exist in a colder part of the world. Heating the community would be profitable. I have two AntMiner S5s running in my spare room that is semi-attached to my house. I think it might have been an addition that was put there in the 1960’s, but it gets ice cold in there during the winter months. I use it as my little hobby/work room and the miners now provide, basically, free heat. I know it is not profitable with the current prices to mine bitcoin at home anymore. I did it as a hobby/educational scientific &amp; engineering research type of a project. I will hold onto the bitcoins until they, hopefully, reach much higher prices. If they ever reach the peak of $1150 again, it will be fairly profitable for me to mine bitcoins. But, then again, I could have used that money to just simply buy bitcoins and that would have been more profitable in the hypothetical scenario where the value of a bitcoin again reaches $1150. I did buy them with a credit card on a 0% APR promotion so I would not have been able to purchase the bitcoins directly with my credit card as I can with the mining hardware. I will also be able to, hopefully, sell the miners in May when the warm weather approaches. This makes mining profitable for my specific case. \r\n\r\nTypically, the only profitable mining can be done by large data centers with very cheap electricity. The cheapest electricity is in China - that is where most mining is done. KnCMiner is setting up mining facilities in the arctic where cool air is free and the electricity will be generated by solar and/or wind. That type of bitcoin mining that is going to survive for a very long time. The others will die in a process of selection of the most fittest mining operations.\r\n\r\n<b>Cloud Mining & Exchanges</b>\r\n\r\nMiners can potentially make more money by selling 12 month contracts because they can sell the hashing power at current rates and by the time 6 months has passed, the company can buy twice the hashing power for the same price in terms of processing and electricity. Note that Moore’s law states computational power on standard chips doubles every 2 years.\r\n\r\nCloud mining is when a mining company sells the shares of their mining hardware. This is done by selling Gh/s, that is Gigahash per second. People make bids to buy or sell a certain number of Gh/s at a certain price. When someone owns the shares they get the earnings that were made from the last block that was solved. The mining company will subtract the maintenance fees from the earnings. Once the maintenance fees are higher than the earning for 10 consecutive days, they will retire the old hardware. They have generations of hardware for sale and the latest hardware gets the most earnings for the least maintenance fees. The profits made from the shares can be used to purchase more shares. And the shares that are owned can be listed in the exchange as for sale and at a higher price than what they were purchased. This may maximize the amount of earnings. However, the prices of the hardware and bitcoin may decline and it is possible to lose money between the buy/sell price and the amount of earnings versus maintenance fees.\r\n\r\n<b>Hash Rate</b>\r\n\r\nThe hash rate has grown to be very powerful and a lot of companies have been dedicated to hashing Bitcoin. The network is currently at about 300 Terahertz (300,000,000 hertz). Hertz means cycles per second. I would not be surprised to see this number get very large. It is growing at an exponential rate. It could soon be measured in petahash, exahash, zettahash or yottahash. Those are real words, too! petahash means 100,000,000 cycles per second. Yottahash means 100,000,000,000 cycles per second. The Bitcoin network is currently around <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate\">300,000,000 GH/s</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Mining Bubbles &amp; Crashes</b>\r\n\r\nMining is directly affected by the price of bitcoin.

The Bitcoin network should be resilient against attacks from terrorists and criminals.

People argue that the Bitcoin can\'t be legitimate because there is no nation that backs it. However, there are many nations that back it. It already has more backing by more nations than any other currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Colonizing the Poles</b>\r\n\r\nAnother claim could be made that the profitability of mining bitcoin could be used to economically colonize the north and south pole.

Terrorists use online social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Terrorists use the USD. Just because terrorists use Bitcoin, does not mean that Bitcoin should be outlawed. That would be the same as banning automobiles because terrorists use automobiles. The logic does not work. Bitcoin has a huge number of uses and just like anything useful, bad people will use it to accomplish their agenda. I do agree that governments will need to spend more effort monitoring the exchanges and the blockchain so that they can track and locate suspicious people.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is also a tool for the law enforcement agencies. All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available for anybody to see. Once an address is connected to an identity, the bitcoins in it can be tracked down the blockchain backwards and forward. The law enforcement agencies will then have clues to finding other criminals and terrorists. They could track down a network of criminals &amp; terrorists.\r\n\r\nI’m certain that wealthy bankers and politicians that are associated with the wealthy bankers will use this as an excuse to try to make more restrictions on Bitcoin. It will be the only tool that the bankers have to compete besides lowering their rates for their services. I don’t think the banks want to lose their largest income streams - very large salaries &amp; bonuses depend on it! If governments start banning Bitcoin by the logic “because terrorists use it”, then they might as well ban airplanes since terrorists use them to crash into buildings. If a government bans Bitcoin with that logic, then they ought to start making it illegal for people to leave their homes since terrorists must leave their homes in order to commit terrorism. I guess the only way to stop terrorists is by stopping all people from leaving their homes. These related arguments against Bitcoin does not hold up if using reasonable logic.\r\n\r\n<b>Following the Chain</b>\r\n\r\nImagine that you could follow the chain of where your money came from. With Bitcoin, you can do that. You can see where the bitcoins were created and to which accounts they were sent to by following the chain of transactions that led the money to you. The anonymity is that the addresses are not associated to anybody. Once the addresses are associated to individuals, then their is no anonymity. Some could argue that this is an invasion of privacy.\r\n\r\nOnce a person that owns some bitcoins is identified, that person could possibly be attached to bitcoins that were used in illegal transactions. It is possible that the bitcoins were legally obtained. It would be wise to keep detailed documentation if you are planning on doing a lot of business with bitcoins. Personally, I would recommend to only purchase bitcoins from a reputable source. If you don’t, then possibly your bitcoins could be seized by a government.\r\n\r\n<strong>Court Orders</strong>\r\n\r\nA court order could be made stating that you turn over your wallet, private key and password to authorities. This can be a good way to track down criminals online but some crimes are controversial such as marijuana. Could the authorities use Bitcoin to track down all the people that buy marijuana with bitcoins once they bust some dealer that has collected bitcoins from a large number of pot purchasers? Yes, they could. I don’t think the efforts would be made for small time criminals, but for larger more organized criminals, the authorities will have an extra tool to investigate. However, the criminals have access to the most advanced financial infrastructure to have ever existed on our planet. The general population does not even know about Bitcoin yet. However, criminals are using it everyday to transfer funds over borders instantly to anybody, anywhere at anytime.\r\n\r\nCould courts ban transactions from being processed if they know that those funds are illegal? A court has jurisdiction over its own borders. Will the miners listen to those court orders? If the transactions in the history mapped to some bitcoin in an innocent persons wallet by legal transactions, could that money be seized? With the USD, money that was stolen can be seized by authorities. I’m not sure how far down a chain the US government could seize dollars that originated from an illegal activity, but similar laws might be applied to bitcoin in the future.','Unethical Bitcoin Uses','','inherit','open','open','','31-revision-v1','','','2015-01-26 23:24:55','2015-01-26 23:24:55','',31,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=122',0,'revision','',0),(123,1,'2015-01-27 00:14:35','2015-01-27 00:14:35','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency.gif\" alt=\"bitcoinismorethanavirtualcurrency\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Other Open Decentralized Networks</b>\r\n\r\nSearch Engines, Email, Social Networks. These could all be created in a similar fashion. They would cut out the big players that are making a huge cut in users online activities. If a community of servers could solve problems like search, social networks, shopping, almost any human to human interaction that we do with a computer. There could be nodes like “miners” in Bitcoin that would contain the correct answers for user queries. The network could intelligently organize any information and reward the organizers. An open source catalog could contain a valid list of the cheapest products that anybody could purchase. All of the computers would work together to locate the best available products for the lowest price. The network could connect commerce with consumers and cut out the costs of large third parties. The nodes that manage the network would be rewarded with commissions if they behave well. If they try to mess up the results, the rest of the network would find out and cut them out for new traffic immediately. This would be a decentralization of the network. Peer-to-peer networks work great for content sharing and currency, why isn\'t it used for other popular online activities?<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>Web 3.0</b>\r\n\r\nIt is the internationalization of the web. People of any language will be able to communicate financially as well as through text and audio/video. You will have a store of wealth online that can easily be transferred to others at your whim. You will be free from corporations and governments limiting your freedoms. It will allow computing resources to be used just like a currency.\r\n\r\n<b>Online Activities Have Too Many Fees</b>\r\n\r\nAn open and distributed network of e-books can be created to allow for publishers to connect directly with their readers. There is no need for corporations to have a monopoly on the system and take huge cuts. Some of the cuts that they take go to pay the banks the fees for their transactions. Bitcoin takes the banks out of the transactions between merchants and consumers. This model of centralized businesses is taking too much of the money away from the the merchants and consumers. The same principle can be applied to advertisements, e-commerce and search engines.\r\n\r\n<b>Post E-Finance</b>\r\n\r\nWhat happens after technology takes over finance? Is the next sight on politics? Will computers handle international laws just as they are starting to handle international financial transactions? There might be an autonomous system where there are an agreed upon set of laws. The system will be able to monitor all people and enforce the laws. There will be no single person or groups of people that can go around the the international laws. As scary as it sounds, this might be a good thing. The system would be much more efficient than the current system since there are so many loopholes and contradictions in laws across borders.\r\n\r\nWill there be some blockchain technology that has all the laws that humans must abide by? The system could reward people that follow and uphold the law and it could punish people that do not follow the law. Having such a system in place might be better than the patchwork of laws that we currently have. Are there some undeniable truths about what it is right and what is wrong? If an alien civilization came to our planet, would there laws be nearly identical to our own laws? There are some many thoughts to ponder about what will happen with technology in general.\r\n\r\n<b>Opinion</b>\r\n\r\nIt will be useful for micro payments online. I personally like it for that. I like to pay $1 or so for goods. I wouldn\'t give a company my credit card or bank information for such a small amount. I have been signed up for cycled billing for a minimum 12 months at $29. I should have read the terms and conditions. It would be harder for businesses to do that with bitcoin. They will be good for international orders also... the international credit card transactions sometimes fail and have to be manually approved. It is cheaper than the current services if you convert USD to bitcoin for free. Businesses usually pay about 3% CC fees and those are passed on to the customers. If the businesses/consumers could lower their prices by 3% for bitcoin customers, it would cut out the banks 3% fee for almost each and every transaction. It adds up after the same $100 gets a 3% transaction fee 10 times as the money spreads through the economy.\r\n\r\n<b>Alt-coins</b>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I don’t think an alt-coin will replace Bitcoin. It will have a small hash history and therefore be less mature. The new alt-coin would be worth about the same price as bitcoin in terms of computing power. Buying a crypto-currency will be directly proportional to how much effort it takes to create it. However, this will not hold true for alt-coins that die. If they get abandoned, then they will not be worth as much to a bitcoin in terms of computing power consumed in their generation. There will be cases where an alt-coin rewards more to mine than bitcoin. However, miners will switch their hardware to that alt-coin and then bitcoin will be easier to mine. This will enforce the price of all of the crypto-currencies to be balanced in the long-term. Some lucky people might get in early on some new alt-coins that will take off and it will be extremely profitable. But as soon as the price for an alt-coin starts rising, more miners will throw their equipment at it. Bitcoin is already \"the\" digital currency and it would be difficult for an alternative to surpass it.\r\n\r\n<b>Superior Digital Currencies</b>\r\n\r\nA currency that had all the abilities that Bitcoin has but was cheaper to mine would be superior. Is mining necessary? Is there a way to make a value exchange network that does not require such expensive computational power? A large network of trust might be able to be built where each node in the network receives a small reward for processing a transaction might be possible. However, the heat giving off from mining could be a valuable resource. This heat needs to be utilized in homes and businesses in areas that are cold.\r\n\r\n<b>Replacing Obsolete &amp; Old Infrastructure</b>\r\n\r\nThere are going to be battles replacing the obsolete &amp; old financial infrastructure that is in place. They will take as much action as possible in court &amp; media campaigns to continue maximizing their profits. Bitcoin offers new &amp; improved services over the old.\r\n\r\n<b>Crazy Claims</b>\r\n\r\nTo claim that Bitcoin can provide all the services of the Banks, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Western Union to name a few sounds crazy, but they all store and exchange wealth. Bitcoin is very effective at storing and exchanging wealth. The part about storing wealth might be argued against since people that bought at $1100 and now it is at $275, but that was an artificial spike and prices are correcting themselves to their true worth.','Bitcoin is More than a Virtual Currency','','inherit','open','open','','33-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 00:14:35','2015-01-27 00:14:35','',33,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=123',0,'revision','',0),(124,1,'2015-01-27 00:16:30','2015-01-27 00:16:30','<b>Proposed System</b>\r\n\r\nA very small amount of bitcoins could be used as another means to moderate web content in 3rd party applications. A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to up-vote it and down-vote it. The more up-votes, the more bitcoins the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoins back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population.\r\n\r\nIf content gets all down-votes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam.

A system could be created that is used to organize data. A content creator could put up some bitcoins for an article. Users would be able to up-vote it and down-vote it. The more up-votes, the more bitcoins the content creator gets back. If it goes up above the average, the content creator could get more bitcoins back then was first put up. The content creators would be rewarded by the expense of the advertisers or spammers that are posting bad content. There should be some leeway for content that is just a little below average because that just might mean it is controversial to a significant percent of the population.\r\n\r\nIf content gets all down-votes, then it is most likely spam. Some content that might be good but is looked at as bad by a significant portion of the population might be labeled as spam.

That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin by buying bitcoins or investing in a Bitcoin related company, then the price of Apple stock will go down - this will effect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin - possibly, the government could print more money to expand the economy and make room for Bitcoin? \r\n\r\nBitcoin has a current USD market value of about $3 Billion which is tiny considering the market it is entering. This does not count the USD that is invested in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $350 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin in 2014 an that is up from only $100 Million the year before. There has already been over $100 Million invested into Bitcoin in the first month of 2015. These investments are growing exponentially and if it continues at the rate we have seen, then should should be over a billion invested in 2016. This huge amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international financial market. The money poured into Bitcoin would be in banks or stocks otherwise - Bitcoin is already disrupting the economy by re-allocating funds from banks and certain corporations.\r\n\r\nThe price of bitcoins will adjust to what the value of Bitcoin is worth. Bitcoin provides extremely useful services and the valuation of Bitcoin related companies and the price of a bitcoin will eventually reflect the services that it provides. If it accounts for just 1% of the economy, then the price of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. That number is huge compared to what they are priced at now! The price of a bitcoin needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth. We will watch these extraordinary events unfold over the next few years and it will be an exciting show!\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining in order to keep the network secure. This is especially true for a particular nation if its\' citizens has assets at stake in the blockchain because it is necessary for nations to protect their citizens\' assets. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset and, therefore, the USA is obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger if their citizens\' are vested into Bitcoin. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger to look for attempted attacks and they will need to retaliate to the attacks. There is already regulation because of the announcements of how bitcoins should be handled - there is proposed official regulation and it will become law in a matter of time.\r\n\r\nThe nations will have to balance their economies to make room for Bitcoin just like it did for the large technology companies that arouse since 2000. A lot of money was moved from different sectors of the economy into technology and a lot of new money was printed to handle the expansion of the economy. The economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides us with a super advanced technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more. Bitcoin is a radical innovation; it is not just a small step! There will probably be more that will happen in international finance in the next 10-20 years with Bitcoin than has happened in all of human history.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, phishing and other growing pains. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using Bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin nor does most of what media reports - they are problems with businesses and individuals that use Bitcoin; they are not problems with Bitcoin itself! It is usually a third party that steals the bitcoins that people have stored on their servers. With Mt. Gox, it is believed to be an inside job. Bitcoin technology does have its\' problems, such as scalability, but the protocol can be updated to handle the problems.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoins get diverted away from certain banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The people that sell their bitcoins and the miners of new bitcoins might just take that money and put it in the same bank, but that money will most likely be diverted away from its\' prior trajectory. \r\n\r\nWhen Bitcoin goes mainstream, there will be an amplified effect on the economies of the world and the economies will have to adapt - the banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for their customers\' money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices for their services or it will entice them to take anti-competitive and unethical actions to stay in power.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','publish','open','open','','electronic-financial-instruments','','\nhttp://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97','2015-02-09 16:45:37','2015-02-09 16:45:37','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126',0,'post','',0),(127,1,'2015-01-27 08:52:47','2015-01-27 08:52:47','<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank.

That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. A system called Ripple might be able to accomplish this. For Bitcoin to succeed, there will need to be some 3rd party agency that offers services similar to credit cards. People want a spending limit of money that they can pay back by the end of the next 30 day billing cycle just like they do with credit cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted lie TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','inherit','open','open','','126-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 08:52:47','2015-01-27 08:52:47','',126,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=127',0,'revision','',0),(128,1,'2015-01-27 08:57:23','2015-01-27 08:57:23','Finance Background as a Creative Concept Art','Finance','','inherit','open','open','','finance','','','2015-01-27 08:57:23','2015-01-27 08:57:23','',37,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(129,1,'2015-01-27 08:57:34','2015-01-27 08:57:34','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-128\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/usdfinance.jpg\" alt=\"Finance\" width=\"556\" height=\"360\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Push vs. Pull</b>\r\n\r\nCredit cards are a pull technology. That is, when you go to purchase a service or product, you are giving your credit card and identification information and then they make a request for funds to your credit card company. The credit card company then authorizes the transaction resulting in the <i>pull transaction</i>. The company and anybody else can make this pull if they have your credit card information With bitcoin, you are sending money to the merchant directly. They don’t even have to authorize you to send them money. This is called a <i>push transaction</i>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Irreversible Transactions</strong>\r\n\r\nOnce you send bitcoins to an address, there is no undoing this - it is an irreversible transaction. With credit cards and ACH, there is a wait period before the money is sent. Also, the money can only sent to merchants that have shared all of their information with the bank or credit card company. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, then the merchant will not receive the funds from the credit card company. The merchant, in turn, makes up for these losses by raising there prices. The consumer ends up paying for this. The credit card companies also advertise that they offer fraud protection, but it is really the merchant that is being forced to offer the fraud protection.\r\n\r\n<b>Centralization vs Decentralization</b>\r\n\r\nThere will have to be a balance between centralization and decentralization. Pure centralization would mean there is one large organization that controls everything. Pure decentralization would mean that each person contributes nearly an equal amount of effort to the system. There must be a balance between these two. We can’t go too far in  either direction or we won’t progress with technology. If we start heading in one direction, a revolutionary product will come out that will bring it back in the other direction. Look back at the mainframes - they were a centralized computer system where dumb terminals would connect to them. Then, we switched towards decentralization by having all the processing power in each individual device. More recently, we have gone back in the direction of centralization with cloud services. Bitcoin is a revolutionary service that is leaning towards decentralization - anybody can have a bank on their own computer. In the end, there will be computation going on everywhere - centralized and decentralized.\r\n\r\n<b>Risky Owning Lots of Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to keep hard copies of large quantities of bitcoins in fire proof safes or in an insured account - otherwise it is a risk and precautions need to be taken. Businesses surrounding safe bitcoin storage are arising. If bitcoins are not stored very carefully, they could be corrupted, lost or stolen. There have been countless tales of people losing bitcoins by computer crashes or having them stolen by hackers. $500,000,000.00, at the time of the theft, were stolen from customers on Mt. Gox.\r\n\r\nThe problem of safely storing large amounts of bitcoin will stop some investors from jumping on board right away. They will wait for an easy to understand and secure solution. They want their accounts to be insured by the FDIC. These services are being launched in Q1 2015. There is a market for professionals to advise wealthy individuals in purchasing bitcoin for their investment portfolio and this market will grow exponentially.\r\n\r\nIt is very dangerous to hold a large amount of cash since it can be lost or stolen. For Credit Cards, they pass the fraud expenses onto the businesses and customers. The loss is distributed more in CC - with bitcoin, it is more easy for an individual to get targeted and lose a lot. It would be a good general rule that if you have a large sum of bitcoins, then you better know exactly what you are doing or hire someone that knows what they are doing. And, make sure you trust the person that you hire - it would be easy for them to steal your bitcoins. Those bitcoins are almost certainly gone forever.\r\n\r\n<b>Banking for All</b>\r\n\r\nA high school student will have the power to run his or her own bank. A high school student from a 3rd world country will have the ability to run his or her own bank. 2/3’s of the worlds population does not have access to banking right now. Most of them have or will have mobile phones with internet access. They will be able to use Bitcoin and get access to the same banking systems that the rest of the world. They will be able to make orders for deliveries of items which otherwise might be more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the not too future, drones will be able to deliver items to places around the world. This is not going to happen for many years, but large companies are currently working on drones that deliver items to people’s doorsteps. If this method of delivering goods proves successful, which it will, then drone development will grow exponentially and we will have drones that can deliver anything, anywhere at anytime. Since Bitcoin can be easily used by anyone, anywhere, at any time and for any amount of money, it will align well with an international drone delivery system.\r\n\r\nSpaceX and Facebook have been looking to create satellites that will allow everybody on the planet to get on the internet. They will be providing cheap mobile phones for little to no costs. Facebook will be able to monetize the traffic from all the new users, so they have an incentive to move fast on this venture. These new people on the web will probably all be using Bitcoin for their financial needs - it is an international digital currency that allows any two parties anywhere on the planet to immediately exchange wealth for nearly free. I should say free since the costs will be absorbed by 3rd party apps that will monetize the traffic with advertisements.\r\n\r\nHistory has never allowed for such a huge leap in financial internationalization before. Gold and the USD came the closest to allowing this so far; Bitcoin is the next chapter in this process. There has already been a confirmed transaction from somebody from North Korea. It is rare and highly illegal for residents of North Korea to make financial contact with anyone outside the country.\r\n\r\n<b>Getting People on Board</b>\r\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle right now is getting people on board. Bitcoin has a bad name and it sounds like it is from a cartoon. People that never heard about Bitcoin before usually laugh when I try to explain it to them. One way to get people on board is by giving free and/or cheap bitcoins in order to get people to become familiar with the name Bitcoin and build trust in the Bitcoin system. For the average person, a very small amount, maybe $1, should be seeded to individuals that otherwise would not get into Bitcoin. For the wealthy people, a discount on bitcoins must be given to them so they can jump on board. The bitcoins need to be re-distributed from the early adopters to a larger population in order to get the Bitcoin market to go mainstream. The early adopters will still benefit because the value of the entire Bitcoin network goes up for each new person that starts using Bitcoin.

It takes the responsibility to print and mint money away from the treasurer. It takes the 3rd parties out of transactions. It allows one user to send money directly to another user basically for free. This website will go over some of the basics of Bitcoin and then go deep into some of the more advanced topics. I will be discussing Bitcoin in relation to the USD and all other financial instruments.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is an international and decentralized network that contains a blockchain with stores of value in it at certain addresses. Just like the USD, Bitcoin provides for a mechanism to store wealth and to make trades. The blockchain contains all of the transactions between these addresses and so much more than that. A user of Bitcoin would need a password and private key to transfer funds from that address. Anybody can send money to the addresses on the Blockchain. The blockchain is also an open network where anybody willing to participate is allowed if they follow the rules. The Blockchain is very complicated and I am only going to give a brief overview of it here at this website.\r\n\r\nIn this website, I will write about some of the most important parts of Bitcoin. I will also give my personal opinion on Bitcoin and go over other peoples opinions. I will discuss everything and anything involving Bitcoin. If you have any topics that you would like me to write about that is related to Bitcoin, please leave a comment below! If I can respond in the comment, I will do that.

This revolutionary technology allows a college student living off student loans the ability to build useful financial applications that can be used by the masses. Before Bitcoin, only the elitist wealthy owners of financial institutions had this ability. Now, anybody can create a revolutionary app to manage financial affairs. This the WWW all over. It is the beginning of a new era like the revolution that happened with smart phones. This one is bigger than the smart phones because Bitcoin has some fierce and powerful competitors. There was no competition for smartphones - well, land lines? Cellphones evolved into smartphones so they are one and the same instead of being a competitor. The WWW had no competitor. The old in store commerce did not even see the threat of e-commerce until it was too late. The people that we will be taking business from are the most wealthy and powerful people. It is the top 1%. It is the top .1% and even higher. They have control of media and they influence what the general population sees and thinks. This is going to be a battle for this new business. The huge transaction fees that banks are bringing in are up for grabs. Whoever creates the new \"killer apps\" can get super wealthy in a short period of time. It won\'t take much. Think about what happened with social networking and Facebook. The killer apps that will be taking the electronic financial market by storm are in development and some have already been launched. Besides the financial market, the blockchain has uses outside financial transactions. It works as a proof of existence: store a hash of a file on the blockchain to prove that the file existed at a certain time. This can be done programatically - someone that wants to put 1,000,000 proofs of existence on the blockchain can easily write a program to accomplish that task. This public ledger of information is immutable, that is, it can not be changed once it is verified and written to a block. This transaction will be a part of history. The transaction will exist for all time.','Bitcoin is Revolutionary','','inherit','open','open','','84-revision-v1','','','2015-01-27 17:58:27','2015-01-27 17:58:27','',84,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=131',0,'revision','',0),(132,1,'2015-01-27 18:03:20','2015-01-27 18:03:20','<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Gc2en3nHxA4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nBitcoin takes the bankers out of banking.

If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is at the bottom. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your incoming disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost. The protocol of bitcoin gets updated. The entire mining community chooses whether to update to the new version or not. If they all agree, then a new version is pushed to the network. All the miners that want to stay with the majority must update their software or they will risk being excluded from the network and their mining efforts would go unrewarded. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees can be maintainable. The system would be able to make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it would take to process it. A client application could negotiate the fees and the user could choose the length it takes for a transaction to process. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a market for free transactions. Intelligent people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement or something like that to a transaction. Some third party will be able to provide free transactions that are high in quality. Look at Gmail. It provides the highest quality e-mail there is and it is free for the user. Google makes money from the ads on the Gmail client. In the distant future when fees start to rise, there will be applications that provide rapid transactions for no fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make make possible making money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. This will create a window between the buy and sell. As long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. This can get complicated because the value of a US dollar that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change. There should be an equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market level. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task. Just like in traditional trading, there are bots that are constantly buying and selling hoping to maximize their profits.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining. This is especially true if a lot of individuals in that economies has assets at stake in the blockchain. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There will be regulation.\r\n\r\n<b>Economies Will Have to Balance</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, and many more. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2008 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin. It was a third party that stole the bitcoin that people had stored on their servers. It is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold about 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $4 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $300 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin. That is up from $100 Million the year before. This amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international digital financial market. And, if that is the case then the value of Bitcoin should adjust to what it is worth. If it account for just 1% of the economy, then the value of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. It\'s needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','inherit','open','open','','126-revision-v1','','','2015-01-29 06:19:22','2015-01-29 06:19:22','',126,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=134',0,'revision','',0),(135,1,'2015-01-29 06:33:11','2015-01-29 06:33:11','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs\" width=\"522\" height=\"382\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-137\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\r\n\r\nUsers will need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin. This also needs to be reported to some credit bureaus. For Bitcoin to succeed, there will need to be some 3rd party agency that offers services similar to credit cards. People want a spending limit of money that they can pay back by the end of the next 30 day billing cycle just like they do with credit cards. They want the 60 day grace period on their balance they don\'t have to pay interest right away. This is a major blocking factor for Bitcoin to go mainstream. Once a reputable company can provide users that have good or excellent credit with a spending limit, then this barrier will be broken. This would open the door to thousands or even millions of new users.\r\n\r\nWith Bitcoin, you will not, anytime soon, get the same 0% APR for 18 months with a $10,000 limit as easily as you currently can with the major credit card issuers. People would rather spend money that they don’t have than to pay immediately with the money that they do have. Most people have debt that they would rather put that money towards so they don’t have to pay interest on it. This gets a lot of people in financial trouble, but it just the way that it is. Hopefully, there will be Bitcoin credit cards where people with excellent credit can get a 10 bitcoin credit where they must pay back just like they do with current credit cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Credit History</b>\r\n\r\nPeople like to have their spending recorded on their credit reports. This shows to the banks that they are capable of repaying a debt. If someone only used bitcoin then they could not build a credit history that is widely accepted as a verification of a users agreement to pay them back. If there was a serious credit agency that could be listed at the end for specifically bitcoin credit history, then this would provide for a major breakthrough. Bitcoin could allow for an effective international credit reporting agency.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to give someone a credit limit in US dollars and allow the user to convert it to bitcoins as needed. This could then be reported to the the standard credit reporting agencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Status</b>\r\n\r\nThere is a company called <a href=\"http://www.btcjam\">BTCJam</a> that allows users to lend their bitcoins to other users. The borrowers will repay the bitcoins they borrowed plus an agreed upon interest rate. The credit history is internal to the system. The borrowers will have their online profiles like Facebook & PayPal verified. They also allow them to have a credit card and checking account that can be verified. If a user has all of these verified, they should be more trustworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not meet the requirements of what is needed for Bitcoin to go mainstream. They need a serious player that will verify credit history on their credit report and report spending to the credit reporting agencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Further Ideas</b>\r\n\r\nAn identity could be linked to a wallet and a users spending could be made available to creditors.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoins, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some at fair market rate. The price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. The price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoins - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoins ever and there is currently about 14,000,000 as of early 2015. Most bitcoins have already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoins per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoins per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoins - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with Bitcoin since bitcoins are fluid. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\n\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\n\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even in virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency that can be used for real tangible products. A two-way virtual currency is one that can be converted from USD and back. Most virtual currencies are one way - you can trade USD for the virtual currency but you can\'t trade the virtual currency for USD. Bitcoin is different since it has so many uses.\n\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\n\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have not yet been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be innovative products that will allow Bitcoin to be used more conveniently than the USD is used.\n\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\n\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount of wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers” or just lucky. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering. Some individuals that have large amounts of bitcoins could become billionaires if Bitcoin goes main stream. You can view the <a href=\"http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100\">BitcoinRichList</a>. The numbers are actually worse than what is displayed at that website. Most large holders of bitcoins have their bitcoins spread out among many different addresses. There are a small number of people that own a large percentage of the bitcoins. This is also true for most currencies and stocks.\n\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\n\nPeople have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current payment methods illegal? They could try to ban Bitcoin stating \"<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\">Terrorists Use Bitcoin</a>\". The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. Some nations are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country\">banning Bitcoin</a>. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is nearly doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue or accelerate.\n\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\n\nBitcoin will continue to maintain its\' price over the long run. It is unique and valuable. It can\'t die because the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35\">Bitcoin network</a> is too powerful. I don\'t see that Bitcoin will be replaced since it is a protocol that can be updated upon agreement of the community. If some feature is desired and the community agrees that it is good, then it should be incorporated into the protocol. This is similar to the HTTP and WWW protocol. The network won\'t be replaced by a superior technology since it can be updated. For the short term, Bitcoin will be volatile - that is, the price will fluctuate up and down. You may purchase bitcoins and find out that it lost 30% of its price in a week. However, the average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since it was first launched in 2009.\n\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\n\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting to buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time they will buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market. However, this volatility should go away as more people are in the market. More people will buy bitcoins when the price goes down and sell bitcoins when the price goes up. This will stop spikes and crashes. The more people that are in Bitcoin, the more pressure there will be on the price. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is low and buy thus bringing the price up. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is high and sell thus bring the price down. Over time, the price will continue to increase just as it has been doing since 2009.\n\n<b>Price</b>\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. These trades will set the current price. The latest trade price will be the advertised current price of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand.\n\nSome people think that a single bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the price will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are currently hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s and growing every month. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\n\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\n\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of a bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $200 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$400. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin and it won\'t stay above what it costs to mine for any significant period of time.\n\nI would approximate that it costs about $150 to mine a bitcoin in an industrial setting. It costs $200+ to mine one from home. Whatever the price to mine a bitcoin, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. Overtime, the rewards to mine get cut in half, so it becomes more expensive to mine. Once that happens, the price should rise. Also, if demand is greater than the number of bitcoins mined, then the price will rise. If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\n\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoins will be redirected to purchasing bitcoins directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that the price of a bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\n\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\n<ol>\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\n\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into Bitcoin very early.\n\n<b>Liquidity</b>\n\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoins immediately after receiving them - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how Bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-31 05:41:44','2015-01-31 05:41:44','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=139',0,'revision','',0),(140,1,'2015-01-30 04:28:07','2015-01-30 04:28:07','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs.jpg\" alt=\"photodune-715349-credit-cards-xs\" width=\"522\" height=\"382\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-137\" /></a>\n\n<b>Credit Limit</b>\n\nUsers will need to be able to get a credit limit with Bitcoin.

They want the 60 day grace period on their balance they don\'t have to pay interest right away. This is a major blocking factor for Bitcoin to go mainstream.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some a fair market rate. They price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. Again, the price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoin - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoin ever and there is currently about 14,000,000. Most bitcoin has already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoin per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoin per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoin - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with bitcoin. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be ingenious inventions that will allow Bitcoin or some similar currency be used just as the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers”. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nIt is currently a monopoly. People have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current VISA/MasterCard/American Express/Discover/Western Union illegal? The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is near doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nEven if Bitcoin is replaced with a superior digital currency, it will continue to maintain some value. Whether it will be a collector’s item in the future or adopted as the mainstream digital currency is a thought to ponder. I’m certain that a competitor to the current financial system will come into existence.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market.\r\n\r\n<b>Value</b>\r\n\r\nThe value of the bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. This will set the price. The latest trade price will be the current value of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand. Some people think that bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the value will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $250 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$600. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin. I would approximate it that it costs at least $200 a bitcoin to mine. That might not be accurate, but whatever the price is, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. If the price does fall below, the money used to mine bitcoin will be redirected to purchasing bitcoin directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that bitcoin does not fall below the $200 threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important from now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoin for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoin for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoin</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want much less.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoin relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and 1 bitcoin will be a milestone for someone to own. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket. There does not yet exist 14 million bitcoin and it will not happen for at least a few months into 2015. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. 90% of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and people that got into bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoin immediately after receiving it. If this is how bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and other reasons. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this as an important factor.\r\n\r\n<b>Balancing Account</b>\r\n\r\nSome variation of a spending &amp; saving account could conceptually be created. They would contain an equal amount of bitcoin and dollar when adding funds to it could be used to maximize saving and spending. If the price of bitcoin has fallen since making a deposit, then spend cash on the current purchase. If the price of bitcoin has risen since making a deposit, then spend bitcoin on the current purchase.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Arbitrage</b>\r\n\r\nArbitrage is when investors buy a bitcoin from one exchange at a lower price and sell it at another price for a higher price. This balances the price between the exchanges. It can be profitable for the investors engaged in this activity. It is a risk, though.

If wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, then people will not want to buy it, so they have to sell some at fair market rate. The price should not skyrocket too much because nobody will buy it when it does and everybody that has it will want to sell it when it does. The price should find an equilibrium. There is a finite amount of bitcoin - there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoins ever and there is currently about 14,000,000 as of early 2015. Most bitcoins have already been mined and pretty much all of it will be mined by 2024. There are currently 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. That is 0.003 bitcoin per person on the planet. That seems like a very small amount of bitcoin per person. The numbers are not really important. Give 0.003 a name, like a millibit, then there are 3 millibits per person. The numbers are infinitely divisible. So people will be able to make transactions at small increments like 0.000003 bitcoin - this is called 3 microbits. Even if wealthy individuals hoard all of the bitcoin, the majority of people will still be able to make cheap or nearly free transactions with bitcoin since bitcoins are fluid. This will make a lot of competition for the current banking markets. It will also make competition for creditors. It may go as far as making a strong competition against national currencies.\r\n\r\n<b>Middle Aged &amp; Younger Will Love Bitcoin</b>\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a choice. They will love Bitcoin because it is familiar to value such an item in video games and even in virtual reality. Most, if not all, video games have some form of point or coin reward system. In the future, these points that people can earn just might be bitcoins or some other equivalent two-way currency. Users of video games and virtual interactive systems will enjoy being rewarded for their participation. Makers of these software systems will be able to profit from their users and in turn reward them with some type of virtual &amp; useful currency that can be used for real tangible products. A two-way virtual currency is one that can be converted from USD and back. Most virtual currencies are one way - you can trade USD for the virtual currency but you can\'t trade the virtual currency for USD. Bitcoin is different since it has so many uses.\r\n\r\n<b>The Bitcoin Financial System</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a large virtual and real financial system. It can exist outside of the pure software world. It can be printed onto paper just like money can and be used that way. There are actual coins that contain bitcoin value on them and they are marked with a symbol that provides evidence that the bitcoins on it have not yet been spent. There are gift cards that are available online and at some retail stores that can be purchased and redeemed. In the future, there will be innovative products that will allow Bitcoin to be used more conveniently than the USD is used.\r\n\r\n<b>Transfer of Wealth</b>\r\n\r\nA lot of wealth may transfer to some of the early adopters of the technology from the hands of the current class of wealthy individuals. The late stage early adopters will gain some amount of wealth, but not that much. The very early adopters are the group commonly labeled as “techies” or “hackers” or just lucky. They are, for the most part, regular people that are interested in computer science &amp; computer engineering. Some individuals that have large amounts of bitcoins could become billionaires if Bitcoin goes main stream. You can view the <a href=\"http://bitcoinrichlist.com/top100\">BitcoinRichList</a>. The numbers are actually worse than what is displayed at that website. Most large holders of bitcoins have their bitcoins spread out among many different addresses. There are a small number of people that own a large percentage of the bitcoins. This is also true for most currencies and stocks.\r\n\r\n<b>Current Systems Are a Monopoly</b>\r\n\r\nPeople have no alternatives to the current banking systems. Will the government try to make alternatives to the current payment methods illegal? They could try to ban Bitcoin stating \"<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=31\">Terrorists Use Bitcoin</a>\". The USA was founded on beliefs of a free market. Is it a free market only for certain commodities? It appears as though Bitcoin has been accepted in American society. It might be too late to try to outlaw it now. Some nations are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_Bitcoin_by_country\">banning Bitcoin</a>. There have been too many investments that have poured into Bitcoin since its\' inception. The amount that is getting invested in Bitcoin is nearly doubling every year and it looks as though this pattern is going to continue or accelerate.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Will Hold Value</b>\r\n\r\nBitcoin will continue to maintain its\' price over the long run. It is unique and valuable. It can\'t die because the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=35\">Bitcoin network</a> is too powerful. I don\'t see that Bitcoin will be replaced since it is a protocol that can be updated upon agreement of the community. If some feature is desired and the community agrees that it is good, then it should be incorporated into the protocol. This is similar to the HTTP and WWW protocol. The network won\'t be replaced by a superior technology since it can be updated. For the short term, Bitcoin will be volatile - that is, the price will fluctuate up and down. You may purchase bitcoins and find out that it lost 30% of its price in a week. However, the average price of bitcoins has steadily risen since it was first launched in 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Market Manipulation</b>\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of rich and average people that will want to use the market to make a profit. They will be attempting to buy at low prices and sell them at high prices. This will make the market swing up and down. This will hurt the average person because they will not have the best judgement as to when to buy and when to sell. They will buy the bitcoins when they need them or at a random time they will buy them for future use. The people that buy bitcoins on a downward slope will be forfeiting wealth to the people that buy and sell stocks for profit. This will hurt Bitcoin by stopping some people from entering the bitcoin market. However, this volatility should go away as more people are in the market. More people will buy bitcoins when the price goes down and sell bitcoins when the price goes up. This will stop spikes and crashes. The more people that are in Bitcoin, the more pressure there will be on the price. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is low and buy thus bringing the price up. Everyone will see opportunity when the price is high and sell thus bring the price down. Over time, the price will continue to increase just as it has been doing since 2009.\r\n\r\n<b>Price</b>\r\n\r\nThe price of the bitcoin is set by the popular exchanges. It works similar to the stock market. People list a certain number of bitcoins for sale on the exchange. This is called a sell order. People make bids to buy a certain number of bitcoins at a certain price. This is called a buy order. If somebody places a buy order for a price at or above a previously listed sell order, then a “buy” occurs. If somebody places a sell order for a price at or below a previously listed buy order, then a “sell” occurs. These trades will set the current price. The latest trade price will be the advertised current price of a bitcoin. This is affected by supply and demand.\r\n\r\nSome people think that bitcoin will be worth thousands of dollars someday. This has a chain reaction that affects the price. If enough people think they will be worth thousands of dollars someday, then the price will go up. This could feed itself and make them worth thousands of dollars someday. This is not a pyramid scheme because there is great utility in Bitcoin. The value of the network needs to be considered. It is a powerful network of computers that are currently hashing at a rate of 340,000,000 GH/s and growing every month. That is a powerful network and the blockchain might be the most encrypted and secure piece of information that exists. It will have a history of all the transactions that happened on the blockchain. This will be an excellent way to store &amp; exchange wealth.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Estimate</b>\r\n\r\nIf someone was to ask me what the price of bitcoin will be at the end of 2015, I would say that it could be between $200 and $2000. I don’t think that is a fair question due to the volatility of bitcoin. The price will dip and peak at a moments notice. A more fair question to ask would be what will the average price of bitcoin be for the entire 2015 year. I think that price would be in the range of $200-$400. I can not see the price of a bitcoin falling below what it costs to mine a bitcoin and it won\'t stay above what it costs to mine for any significant period of time.\r\n\r\nI would approximate that it costs about $150 to mine a bitcoin in an industrial setting. It costs $200+ to mine one from home. Whatever the price to mine a bitcoin, I think it will be a barrier that the price will not fall below. Overtime, the rewards to mine get cut in half, so it becomes more expensive to mine. Once that happens, the price should rise. Also, if demand is greater than the number of bitcoins mined, then the price will rise. If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\r\n\r\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoin will be redirected to purchasing bitcoin directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoin immediately after receiving it - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoin for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoin and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoin and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-revision-v1','','','2015-01-30 22:52:08','2015-01-30 22:52:08','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=149',0,'revision','',0),(150,1,'2015-01-31 05:42:05','2015-01-31 05:42:05','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8642373-digital-illustration-of-house-on-money-stack-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-145\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photodune-8642373-digital-illustration-of-house-on-money-stack-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Digital illustration of house on money stack\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Hoarders</b>\r\n\r\nHoarding will have to be balanced.

If demand is lower than the number of bitcoins mined, the price will fall.\r\n\r\nIf the price of a bitcoin falls below what it costs to mine, then the money used to mine bitcoins will be redirected to purchasing bitcoins directly from the people that already own bitcoin. This will, in turn, cause more people to stop mining and that, in turn, will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin. This cycle will ensure that the price of a bitcoin does not fall below the threshold for any significant period of time. Most people say the price in the short run is not important at all. It is the widespread adoption that is important for now. Once widespread adoption occurs, then the price of bitcoins will have no other choice but to go up. It is the physics of the Bitcoin system - it is the laws of the Bitcoin network!\r\n\r\nHere are four groups of people that could make the price of bitcoins skyrocket:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>There will be over 14 million that want 1 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be over 1 million that want 14 bitcoins for their investment portfolio</li>\r\n	<li>There will be a few very rich people that will want much more than 14 bitcoins</li>\r\n	<li>Then, there will be the rest of the people that will want bitcoins for spending.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<b>Bitcoin Price Volatility</b>\r\n\r\nThere are very few bitcoins relative the number of people that there are. People are psychological creatures and owning 1 bitcoin will be a milestone. If there are 14 million such people that will want to own 1 bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin will skyrocket - there are not 14 million bitcoins in existence right now. By the end of 2015, there will be about 14.5 million bitcoin. A large percentage of these bitcoins will be hoarded by investors and other people that got into Bitcoin very early.\r\n\r\n<b>Liquidity</b>\r\n\r\nMany large companies liquidate their bitcoins immediately after receiving them - that is, they immediately convert them to USD. If this is how Bitcoin will be utilized by many companies, then this may cause the price of a bitcoin to stay at lower prices for a while. People will want to buy bitcoins for its’ benefits of shopping online and off. Then they will spend the bitcoins and it will be sold again. However, there will be hoarders that will buy up the bitcoins and wait for the price to rise. This will work over time and it will work short term if people buy in the crashes and sell in the bubbles. Then again, when a lot of people are buying during a crash, then the price will rise. If a lot of people are selling during a bubble, the price will fall. Again, some equilibrium will be found with this being an important factor in the price equation.','Bitcoin Investments','','inherit','open','open','','40-revision-v1','','','2015-01-31 05:42:05','2015-01-31 05:42:05','',40,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=150',0,'revision','',0),(151,1,'2015-01-31 05:51:19','2015-01-31 05:51:19','An image of a nuclear bomb explosion','nuclear bomb explosion','','inherit','open','open','','nuclear-bomb-explosion','','','2015-01-31 05:51:19','2015-01-31 05:51:19','',42,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(152,1,'2015-01-31 06:32:26','2015-01-31 06:32:26','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-151\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\" alt=\"nuclear bomb explosion\" width=\"447\" height=\"447\" /></a></b>\n\n<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\n\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two nations won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have the potential to destroy the other. Like a nuclear war between superpowers, there can be no winners. The Bitcoin network lives on the same principle. Too many people have investments in Bitcoin to allow it to fail. Nobody would benefit from somebody breaking the integrity of Bitcoin. If someone pulls a 51% attack, then people would lose the trust in the system and bitcoin would lose all of its value. The perpetrators would make now gains because the system would be destroyed. Any parties that are interested in Bitcoin will attempt to prevent such an attack. The overwhelming majority of the Bitcoin network and their supporters will back the integrity of the system.\n\nGovernments will back the integrity of the system because they are obligated to protect their citizens\' interests. However, there will be controversy when governments attempt to freeze wallet addresses on the blockchain that contain illegally obtained bitcoin. The protocol does not currently support these freezes, but could governments force such a change? Read about the proposed Hot List further\n\n<b>Network of Trust</b>\n\nIf all the parties can come to a fair agreement of how much hashing power is needed, then there wouldn\'t need to be a race to the bottom by wasting efforts on mining. It is naturally competitive as to reward the parties with the most hashing power. This agreement will not come as a verbal agreement between the parties but it will be agreed upon naturally through the price of a bitcoin.\n\nLike in real life, no one party will want to take over more than 51% of the network because the value of the system would dwindle and their profits would dwindle. There will always be several large competitors that will prevent any one entity from controlling 51% of the network.\n\nSomeone that has control of 51% of the network will want to keep the integrity of the transactions - they would not benefit from altering any information in the network. The system will maintain a natural balance between people around the world - they will want to be friendly with each other. A majority of people are good and the network is an image of the miners and users of Bitcoin. It is a natural trust based system with laws to hold integrity.\n\nThe price of a bitcoin will be worth what people will make it worth. People will naturally make the Bitcoin network worth the services that it provides. If it does provide all the services of banking and credit cards and a whole lot more, then it will be extremely valuable. All parties that are involved with Bitcoin will want it to continue to succeed. An attack from outside the bitcoin network would be the most likely since Bitcoin competitors would benefit from the system failing. However, it would be cheaper for an outside party to buy into the network and try to control it from within. Terrorists will not ever acquire enough power to take down 51% of the network. Governments may have the power to do this. But, the governments that have that much power would be able to acquire control of much of bitcoin through mining and purchasing bitcoin. Also, governments are obligated to protect their citizens\' assets.\n\n<b>Bitcoin vs Manual Audits</b>\n\nA transaction and store of value system like the current financial institutions use manual audits to ensure the integrity of their network. Any business can be audited to make sure all transactions are accurate and complete. If they are not, they will suffer legal consequences. Is the current setup of audits more efficient than Bitcoin mining? I would say no since the credit card and bank fees are so high. A competitor, like Bitcoin, will ensure that the financial institutions are working as efficiently as possible because if they don\'t, then their customers may leave. The financial institutions will have to be able to compete with the services that Bitcoin is offering and they have to do it with either more quality, better security, or for cheaper. Options are always a good thing for consumers. It will force the financial sector to compete for customers. They may use many methods to compete.\n\n<b>Attention in Media</b>\n\nIt can be profitable for news agencies to report on the fallacies of Bitcoin. These reports, in turn, make Bitcoin less valuable. It is a downward spiral. However, people communicate with each other. There are lots of more people using Bitcoin and their are <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">statistics</a> to prove it. They will teach their friends of its’ advantages. Their friends will teach their friends and that cycle will continue until the general public is educated about the facts of Bitcoin.\n\n<b>Community Agrees To Update</b>\n\nIf a general consensus among the Bitcoin miners agree to change the protocol, then this could have significant implications for the digital currency. This happens a lot for minor updates and is discussed in the Bitcoin community for major changes. A hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin miners might want to change the having of Bitcoin rewards to every 8 years instead of every 4 years is possible, but it is unlikely that a majority of people would agree to that. It would be profitable for the miners to do such a thing. But, this would cause belief in the system to dwindle and hurt them more than reward them.\n\nPeople value bitcoin as a store of wealth and unethical changes to the protocol would cause the price to plummet. Many miners are deeply vested into Bitcoin and they do not want this to happen because it would not be beneficial to them. If something like this did happen, there would probably be a fork and the existing version would run in parallel to the new version. That would be terrible for the system for everyone involved. People would have to decide which fork to choose between. Current holders would want the old version and people that want to get on board might want the new version. I think that the community would see all the struggles that taking such an action would cause and they would not want to damage the market that they exist in. These scenarios are hypothetical and not practical.\n\n<b>Fork</b>\n\nA fork in Bitcoin is when there are two separate versions that have been worked on and they share a previous point where they were the same - they share a common ancestor. For example, github hosts software projects for developers and when someone has a public project up there, someone else could fork a copy of the current version and start working on it in parallel. The original developer would also be working on the original version. They could both save their copies and they would be different and not share the changes that were made by both of the parties. Some people suggest that a fork in the bitcoin could be used. It would take a majority of the miners to approve a different version that will be accepted by the community. In practice, there would be an overwhelming majority that agrees to any updates because it would not be beneficial to anyone otherwise. It would be a guaranteed loss for everyone!\n\nIn the event that a successful 51% attack on the system happens, there would be a fork with the 49% that maintains the integrity. Users would have to ensure they are using the \"good\" fork. This attack is theoretically possible but in practice, it is impossible.\n\n<b>Hot List</b>\n\nHypothetically, there could be a hot list added to Bitcoin. If enough miners agreed to update the core code, then a hot list of addresses holding stolen bitcoins could be frozen. They would then be able to use them for legitimate uses. This would render those bitcoins nearly useless and it would make it not so profitable for bad people to steal bitcoins from people. This would be hard to maintain and it should be hard for a person to place addresses in a hot list but it would be beneficial for the entire system and help it be accepted in the mainstream. The original holder of the bitcoins would have to prove that the bitcoins do indeed belong to them. Once it is on the host list, it would be worth little to nothing. This might even influence some hackers to give the bitcoin back for an agreed small percentage of legal bitcoin. This hot list would probably only be feasible for large thefts.\n\n<b>Charitable Donations</b>\n\nWhen you donate money to a 3rd world country, not all of that money reaches there. If you wanted to donate $1, probably about $0.10 will reach the hungry child that you wanted to feed and the other $0.90 ends up going to the 3rd parties in between. With Bitcoin, it will be possible to donate $1 to starving children and $1 will reach its targeted donation. The implications of what Bitcoin could do for the world are huge. It is <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\">arguably free</a> to use! There will be 3rd party applications that will absorb any costs to send money. The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\n\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\n\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes. This is currently the case, but it is easy to convert bitcoins to USD and possibly in the future, the IRS might reconsider. NYC is proposing allowing people to <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/31/new-york-parking-ticket-app/\">pay parking tickets with bitcoins</a>. This would save the people and the city a lot of money in financial fees with credit cards and the costs associated with mailing checks. Bitcoin would be useful for collecting tolls on highways for the same reasons. People could get a sticker on their car and have the payment automatically go through. This would save the highway management and people money by cutting out the banks from the middle of the transaction.\n\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin Theories & Concepts','','inherit','open','open','','42-autosave-v1','','','2015-01-31 06:32:26','2015-01-31 06:32:26','',42,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=152',0,'revision','',0),(153,1,'2015-01-31 06:22:38','2015-01-31 06:22:38','<b><a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-151\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nuclear-bomb-explosion-xs.jpg\" alt=\"nuclear bomb explosion\" width=\"447\" height=\"447\" /></a></b>\r\n\r\n<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>\r\n\r\nMutually Assured Destruction is when two nations won’t have a serious conflict with each other because both sides have the potential to destroy the other.

The applications will generate revenue with the traffic to its’ services just like Gmail provides free e-mail and Facebook provides free social networking.\r\n\r\n<b>Bitcoin Can’t Be Used to Pay Taxes</b>\r\n\r\nI have heard a lot of arguments stating that Bitcoin is useless because it can not be used to pay taxes. This is currently the case, but it is easy to convert bitcoins to USD and possibly in the future, the IRS might reconsider. NYC is proposing allowing people to <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/31/new-york-parking-ticket-app/\">pay parking tickets with bitcoins</a>. This would save the people and the city a lot of money in financial fees with credit cards and the costs associated with mailing checks. Bitcoin would be useful for collecting tolls on highways for the same reasons. People could get a sticker on their car and have the payment automatically go through. This would save the highway management and people money by cutting out the banks from the middle of the transaction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Bitcoin Theories & Concepts','','inherit','open','open','','42-revision-v1','','','2015-01-31 06:32:43','2015-01-31 06:32:43','',42,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=154',0,'revision','',0),(155,1,'2015-01-31 23:38:26','2015-01-31 23:38:26','software code and program, C program, technology','software program','','inherit','open','open','','software-program','','','2015-01-31 23:38:26','2015-01-31 23:38:26','',45,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/software-program-xs.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(156,1,'2015-02-01 10:30:40','2015-02-01 10:30:40','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/software-program-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-155\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/software-program-xs.jpg\" alt=\"software program\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>\n\nBitcoin is programmable because it is so easy to write programs to automatically send money back and forth.

It is not a significant difference compared to buying it right now. However, you could be mining bitcoins for cheaper than you could buy bitcoins or buy bitcoins for cheaper than you could mine them. You can do the math and make your best guesses at what the hash-rate, difficulty, the price of a bitcoin, shipping, electricity, etc... You can make an upper and lower bound of what you will make and compare it to what the price would be if you just bought the bitcoins outright. If the price jumps up in a few months, you won’t be able to buy it for as cheap as you could mine it. I would recommend mining bitcoin if you are a DIY hobbyist type of a person that would enjoy doing such a thing.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds silly, but heating homes in cold climates might be profitable. I just bought two AntMiner S5s because I have an un-insulated addition on my apartment that does not have heat. I live in New England. I was going to buy a space heater for that room anyways. I do the mining as a hobby, but I think it would be a brilliant idea to make home heating systems as Bitcoin miners. The components would need to be able to be easily upgraded to keep up with the growth rate of the processors required to mine. I would be thinking about getting a couple for each room if they weren\'t so loud. It would be cheaper than using my gas heat. The mining hardware will get quieter over time. Maybe I could attach a dryer vent around the front of it and place it in my basement having the heat come up into my apartment. This is where the future is heading. Home &amp; Business heating will be done from the heat given off by a distributed system of supercomputers.\r\n\r\n<b>Should I Buy Bitcoin?</b>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say yes. Investing is always risky and this risk is higher than average. However, with great risks, come great rewards. It has the potential to go to extreme heights, but it is impossible to tell when. It could fall to a lower price and stay there for a while. We don’t know what that price might be. It could be replaced with a superior cryptocurrency. Governments could start creating their own crypto currencies. The USD might someday be a crypto-currency that will be printed on paper embedded with a tiny chip. I think in the not too distant future, a bitcoin will be worth thousands. It might go down below $100 before that happens, but it is much too useful to stay at such a low price for very long. I can\'t say whether it will be tomorrow or next year or 5 years, but the price will go up eventually. It must go up considering what it can be used for and the adaptability of the network to sustain itself no matter what the price of a bitcoin is.','Bitcoin: Buy or Mine?','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-02-01 10:32:56','2015-02-01 10:32:56','',13,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=165',0,'revision','',0),(166,1,'2015-02-01 13:29:12','2015-02-01 13:29:12','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52\" style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/introducingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"introducingbitcoinusd\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" /></a>\n\nBitcoin is a tool to move wealth from old financial institutions to a younger more tech savvy crowd.

It won\'t take much for technologists to enter or at least come close to the ranks of the 1% in this crucial point in history.

It works as a proof of existence: store a hash of a file on the blockchain to prove that the file existed at a certain time in history. The document will be notarized. This can be done programatically - someone that wants to put 1,000,000 proofs of existence on the blockchain can easily write a program to accomplish that task. This public ledger of information is immutable, that is, it can not be changed once it is verified and written to a block. This transaction will be a part of history. The transaction will exist for all time.','Bitcoin is Revolutionary','','inherit','open','open','','84-revision-v1','','','2015-02-01 11:16:27','2015-02-01 11:16:27','',84,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=167',0,'revision','',0),(168,1,'2015-02-01 11:26:26','2015-02-01 11:26:26','It is true that extra security needs to be taken to stop bitcoins from being stolen, but the same problem exists for automobiles. I don\'t think people should not buy or use automobiles because they might get stolen. People could only use trains and buses so they don\'t have to worry about their car being stolen, but a car can be much more convenient than a bus or train. Similarly, bitcoins can be much more convenient than cash or credit cards, however, it is more risky just like having an automobile is more risky than a train or bus. Credit cards and cash are much more limiting than Bitcoin and they are also more expensive. Buses and trains are typically cheaper than cars, but are very limiting.\r\n\r\nFor Mt. Gox, it was concluded that it was an inside job by the owners of the company. They stole nearly $500,000,000 worth of bitcoins at the time. The price was artificially inflated by bots during that period so the actual value was probably closer to $100,000,000 worth of bitcoins. We are in the early stages like in the wild west with gold - there will be some high profile hacks and lots of little hacks. In the wild west, there were several notable high profile robberies and many small robberies of gold. Over time, the theft of gold was pretty much eliminated, but it does occasionally happen now - people get robbed for their necklaces and stores get robbed, but there are rarely any large scale gold heists anymore.','Bitcoin Security','','inherit','open','open','','94-revision-v1','','','2015-02-01 11:26:26','2015-02-01 11:26:26','',94,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=168',0,'revision','',0),(169,1,'2015-02-01 11:30:19','2015-02-01 11:30:19','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoin-dollar-xs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-161\" src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoin-dollar-xs.jpg\" alt=\"bitcoin-dollar-xs\" width=\"548\" height=\"365\" /></a>One problem that Bitcoin addresses is online micro payments.

This revolutionary technology allows a college student living off student loans the ability to build useful financial applications that can be used by the masses. Before Bitcoin, only the elitist wealthy owners of financial institutions had this ability. Now, anybody can create a revolutionary app to manage financial affairs.\r\n\r\nThis is the WWW all over again; it is the beginning of a new era like the revolution that happened with smart phones. This one is bigger than the smart phones because Bitcoin has some fierce and powerful competitors unlike the smart phone. There was no competition for smartphones - well, land lines? Cellphones evolved into smartphones so they are \"one and the same\" instead of being a competitor. The WWW had no competitor; the old in store commerce did not even see the threat of e-commerce until it was too late.\r\n\r\nThe people that Bitcoiners will be taking business from are the most wealthy and powerful people. It is the top 1%. It is the top .1% and even higher. They have control of media and they influence what the general population sees and thinks.

You might ask: \"What are we going to do with all of the old paper currencies?\" Well, we could certainly start building financial museums and someday bring our grandchildren there telling them: \"this is what we used to use when we were young\". Will it be just Bitcoin in the future? Absolutely not! The USD is almost a digital money already. Most transactions are done with credit cards or bank wires, but Bitcoin will have its role to play in the world. The USD is mostly just digits on a screen, anyhow - they are very similar, but Bitcoin has a lot of useful features that the USD does not have. It is possible that the USD will convert to a model that is more similar to Bitcoin, but that would be difficult to accomplish considering the foundations of our financial infrastructure was built on the current properties of the USD. If the USD acquires all the features that Bitcoins has, which it won\'t, will Bitcoin still have a role to play? Yes, I would say - Bitcoin is an extremely powerful <a title=\"Electronic Financial Instruments\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=126\">financial instrument</a> that is <a title=\"Bitcoin is Programmable Money\" href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45\">easily programmable</a>!\n\nThe current owners of the physical money are not going to need to trade in their old bills. It would be wise for people to diversify their assets in case if the price of a bitcoin rises significantly compared to the USD.\n\nWill Bitcoin be one of the worlds\' currencies? It absolutely will be - it already has! The real question is: \"how large of a fraction of the pie of currencies will Bitcoin become?\"  Currently, most transactions with the USD and other fiat currencies are already digital. There is not actual physical cash that exists for all of the money that is out there. When someone gets a loan from the bank, they are lending out money that is in their accounts that belong to other people. So, do the people that have the money in their bank accounts also have that money, too? Does the account holder have $100,000 in the bank even though the bank lent that $100,000 to a home owner? That is $200,000 worth of money but only $100,000 in cash actually exists. Banks are required to hold 15% of the \"money\" as physical \"cash\". The rest is insured by the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/\">FDIC</a> (up to a certain amount) if account holders need their cash but the bank does not have it. There is no FDIC insurance for a Bitcoin wallet, but there are exchanges that offer private insurance on their accounts such as <a href=\"http://www.circle.com/\">Circle</a> and <a href=\"http://xapo.com/\">Xapo</a>.\n\nBank account holders are in fact lending their money to people that are holding debt to the bank. The account holders sometimes get some small amount of interest for the money in their bank accounts - it is not significant; it won\'t keep up with inflation. On top of the potential interest, the banks provide services in exchange for the bank holders\' cash. What would happen if a large number of people went to their banks and took out all of their money? The banks would not have enough. The FDIC insures the accounts so they have to send the money to the banks so they can give them to the account holders. If this happened rapidly, the FDIC would have to get the treasury to print a lot of money to payback the account holders. The people with debt to the bank would owe the bank and the FDIC the money on their loan. The home owner might or might not have a lot of wealth if they have a mortgage on their home. Homes would go way up in USD value since there is more money in circulation - most of them will have fixed rate interest.  The homeowners would benefit because there home would be worth more than what they owe on it but people holding actual money would be hurt because of the inflation.\n\nHow much would a large influx of investors buying bitcoins affect the financial system? The people that previously had the bitcoins and sold them to the people that took the money out of their banks to buy bitcoins will have a large portion of USD and possibly they will keep a significant portion of these bitcoins. This will potentially displace some of the funds from the banks and their other investments. Most of the USD will end up back in the banks which will, in turn, lend them out and the cycle will continue. Even if Bitcoin went mainstream, it will not cause a financial crisis; it will only open up more opportunity and cause the existing financial infrastructure to be more efficient and competitive. It may cause some obsolete services to go away.\n\nWhat happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. This will cause the Bitcoin to rise against the USD and it will transfer wealth to Bitcoin holders. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to mostly maintain the current distribution of wealth. Bitcoin has a long way to go to become relevant, but it is <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">growing rapidly</a>. There will be quite a few new millionaires and billionaires if Bitcoin goes mainstream. Bitcoin technology just might be the world\'s next largest international financial system that is widely recognized. Gold is an example of an international transaction system, but it is for the museums &amp; collectors now; it is impractical to use it for transactions.\n\n\"Receipts of gold\" was the next international transaction system - these receipts were called dollars, but then the dollars got detached from Gold. They then started making receipts for the dollar and transacted the receipts instead of transacting physical dollars - those were checks. They then created the Internet and could send digital receipts of the physical dollars - those were wire transfers and credit/debit cards. The current system is a mixture of  dollars, receipts of dollars and digital receipts of dollars. It is easy to exchange the digital receipts of dollars. Bitcoin is superior to digital receipts of dollars since it is self-contained. There has to be a lot of trust built between the parties when utilizing the current financial model since digital receipts of dollars are worthless unless if they are honored. With Bitcoin, this trust is not needed; once the transaction is complete, the wealth transfer has been honored and it can\'t be reversed. The Bitcoin system enforces integrity: money can only be sent from a wallet if a private key is provided. There is no need for an inefficient central authority to guarantee the integrity of transactions; Bitcoin transactions can be made with absolute certainty.','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','inherit','open','open','','64-autosave-v1','','','2015-02-02 00:22:27','2015-02-02 00:22:27','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=173',0,'revision','',0),(174,1,'2015-02-01 22:44:58','2015-02-01 22:44:58','<a href=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65\" src=\"http://104.239.136.101/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/replacingbitcoinusd.gif\" alt=\"replacingbitcoinusd\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe use of physical money will be replaced by digital currencies.

The people that previously had the bitcoins and sold them to the people that took the money out of their banks to buy bitcoins will have a large portion of USD and possibly they will keep a significant portion of these bitcoins. This will potentially displace some of the funds from the banks and their other investments. Most of the USD will end up back in the banks which will, in turn, lend them out and the cycle will continue. Even if Bitcoin went mainstream, it will not cause a financial crisis; it will only open up more opportunity and cause the existing financial infrastructure to be more efficient and competitive. It may cause some obsolete services to go away.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when transactions are replaced by bitcoins? The USD would be used less. This will cause the Bitcoin to rise against the USD and it will transfer wealth to Bitcoin holders. I think wealthy people will be able to purchase enough bitcoins and have enough control to mostly maintain the current distribution of wealth. Bitcoin has a long way to go to become relevant, but it is <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts\">growing rapidly</a>. There will be quite a few new millionaires and billionaires if Bitcoin goes mainstream. Bitcoin technology just might be the world\'s next largest international financial system that is widely recognized. Gold is an example of an international transaction system, but it is for the museums &amp; collectors now; it is impractical to use it for transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Receipts of gold\" was the next international transaction system - these receipts were called dollars, but then the dollars got detached from Gold. They then started making receipts for the dollar and transacted the receipts instead of transacting physical dollars - those were checks. They then created the Internet and could send digital receipts of the physical dollars - those were wire transfers and credit/debit cards. The current system is a mixture of  dollars, receipts of dollars and digital receipts of dollars. It is easy to exchange the digital receipts of dollars. Bitcoin is superior to digital receipts of dollars since it is self-contained. There has to be a lot of trust built between the parties when utilizing the current financial model since digital receipts of dollars are worthless unless if they are honored. With Bitcoin, this trust is not needed; once the transaction is complete, the wealth transfer has been honored and it can\'t be reversed. The Bitcoin system enforces integrity: money can only be sent from a wallet if a private key is provided. There is no need for an inefficient central authority to guarantee the integrity of transactions; Bitcoin transactions can be made almost instantly with absolute certainty.','Bitcoin Replacing Physical Currencies','','inherit','open','open','','64-revision-v1','','','2015-02-02 00:22:46','2015-02-02 00:22:46','',64,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=175',0,'revision','',0),(185,1,'2015-02-02 01:52:16','2015-02-02 01:52:16','<script src=\"wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/js/highcharts/js/highcharts.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/js/highcharts/js/modules/exporting.js\"></script>\r\n<label for=\"spinner\">Days Average:</label>\r\n<input id=\"spinnerValue\" name=\"value\" value=\"1\">\r\n<button id=\"update\">Update</button>\r\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"min-width: 275px;

However, how stable is the the alt-coin? There are no alt-coins that have the market capital as high as Bitcoin. If you wanted to buy $100,000 worth of an alt-coin, the price would probably triple and then many people would dump the coin and you would not be able to sell the coins for the same price that you paid for them. If you bought $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, you have some assurance that the price of your bitcoins should remain near what they were when you bought them - the price wouldn\'t be impacted too much because of the purchase. Also, what is the security of the alt-coin? There are no alt-coins that provide the level of security that Bitcoin provides. Overall, there are currently no alt-coins that provide the benefits that Bitcoin provides. If an alt-coin has some new and improved feature that Bitcoin does not have, then the Bitcoin protocol can be updated to acquire the feature. If the feature is in a different family as Bitcoin, then possibly the new alt-coin would provide a different set of services than Bitcoin and the market would allow for both of them. The world of crypto-currencies is in its\' infancy and it is the next era of technological evolution.','Bitcoin Only Backed by Faith?','','publish','open','open','','bitcoin-only-backed-by-faith','','','2015-02-09 16:34:49','2015-02-09 16:34:49','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=214',0,'post','',0),(215,1,'2015-02-09 05:46:51','2015-02-09 05:46:51','Graphic depicting a cross radiating light and binary digits - representing the use of digital technology to spread the Word of God.','Faith in the Digital Age','','inherit','open','open','','faith-in-the-digital-age','','','2015-02-09 05:46:51','2015-02-09 05:46:51','',214,'http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/faith-in-the-digital-age-xs.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(216,1,'2015-02-09 05:46:57','2015-02-09 05:46:57','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/faith-in-the-digital-age-xs.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/faith-in-the-digital-age-xs.jpg\" alt=\"Faith in the Digital Age\" width=\"374\" height=\"534\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-215\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI keep hearing the argument that bitcoins only have value because people believe they have value.

That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin by buying bitcoins or investing in a Bitcoin related company, then the price of Apple stock will go down - this will effect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin - possibly, the government could print more money to expand the economy and make room for Bitcoin? \n\nBitcoin has a current USD market value of about $3 Billion which is tiny considering the market it is entering. This does not count the USD that is invested in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $350 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin in 2014 an that is up from only $100 Million the year before. There has already been over $100 Million invested into Bitcoin in the first month of 2015. These investments are growing exponentially and if it continues at the rate we have seen, then should should be over a billion invested in 2016. This huge amount of funding going into something this early shows that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the international financial market. The money poured into Bitcoin would be in banks or stocks otherwise - Bitcoin is already disrupting the economy by re-allocating funds from banks and certain corporations.\n\nThe price of bitcoins will adjust to what the value of Bitcoin is worth. Bitcoin provides extremely useful services and the valuation of Bitcoin related companies and the price of a bitcoin will eventually reflect the services that it provides. If it accounts for just 1% of the economy, then the price of all bitcoins should be worth about 1% of what the economy is worth. That number is huge compared to what they are priced at now! The price of a bitcoin needs to be worth enough to sustain a certain dollar amount of trade and store of wealth. We will watch these extraordinary events unfold over the next few years and it will be an exciting show!\n\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\n\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining in order to keep the network secure. This is especially true for a particular nation if its\' citizens has assets at stake in the blockchain because it is necessary for nations to protect their citizens\' assets. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset and, therefore, the USA is obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger if their citizens\' are vested into Bitcoin. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger to look for attempted attacks and they will need to retaliate to the attacks. There is already regulation because of the announcements of how bitcoins should be handled - there is proposed official regulation and it will become law in a matter of time.\n\nThe nations will have to balance their economies to make room for Bitcoin just like it did for the large technology companies that arouse since 2000. A lot of money was moved from different sectors of the economy into technology and a lot of new money was printed to handle the expansion of the economy. The economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides us with a super advanced technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more. Bitcoin is a radical innovation; it is not just a small step! There will probably be more that will happen in international finance in the next 10-20 years with Bitcoin than has happened in all of human history.\n\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\n\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, phishing and other growing pains. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using Bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin nor does most of what media reports - they are problems with businesses and individuals that use Bitcoin; they are not problems with Bitcoin itself! It is usually a third party that steals the bitcoins that people have stored on their servers. With Mt. Gox, it is believed to be an inside job. Bitcoin technology does have its\' problems but the protocol can be updat\n\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\n\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The people that sell their bitcoins and the miners of new bitcoins might just take that money and put it in the same bank, but that money will most likely be diverted away from its\' prior trajectory. \n\nWhen Bitcoin goes mainstream, there will be an amplified effect on the economies of the world and the economies will have to adapt - the banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for their customers\' money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices for their services or it will entice them to take anti-competitive and unethical actions to stay in power.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','inherit','open','open','','126-autosave-v1','','','2015-02-09 15:50:38','2015-02-09 15:50:38','',126,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=218',0,'revision','',0),(219,1,'2015-02-09 14:38:49','2015-02-09 14:38:49','<a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Onedolar2009series.jpg\"><img src=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Onedolar2009series.jpg\" alt=\"Onedolar2009series\" width=\"1216\" height=\"528\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-217\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<b>Adding Another Factor</b>\r\n\r\nFor new purchases online, I wonder whether to spend bitcoin or USD when I am purchasing. If I think that bitcoin is going down, I should use bitcoin before it goes down and then just purchase bitcoin when it is lower. Some people watch the markets and might be good at being able to make predictions. They could record when they bought and make sure to use it only after bitcoin reaches +20% in value versus the USD. When you receive cash, use the cash only after bitcoin reaches -20% in value versus the USD. If we still see all of this volatility, people that do this will see a maximum purchasing power versus just using one form of payment. You might want to keep 50% USD and 50% bitcoin out of all of your disposable income. If you have leeway of when you can make purchases, then wait for a price dip or spike before making any purchases for goods or services.\r\n\r\n<b>Transaction Fees</b>\r\n\r\nFor the near foreseeable future, transaction fees are an insignificant cost since the <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=97\" title=\"Bitcoin Cost vs. Value\">miners make their profits</a> by being rewarded a certain number of bitcoins. The number of bitcoins rewarded gets cut in half every four years. If the volume of transactions grow large enough, then the fees will be significant profit for the miners. The volume of transactions or the transaction fees themselves must grow in order for the system to survive since the newly rewarded bitcoins get diminished over time. \r\n\r\nThe system can make an estimate for a fee for a transaction and the time it will take to process it. The client application calculates the fees. The transactions that include a higher fee will have higher priority in the system. There will be a huge market for free transactions just like the model with E-Mail and WWW. Most websites and e-mail services are free and the providers make their profits by advertising. This is what is happening with Bitcoin. Intelligent and innovative people will find ways to handle transactions for free by attaching an advertisement to the transaction so people in the network will see them.\r\n\r\n<b>Buy/Sell at Spread</b>\r\n\r\nPeople can make money by buying and selling at the same time around the asking price. Try to buy at 0.00000001 above the highest listing order and sell at 0.00000001 below the lowest selling price. If you continue to do this and keep a spread between the buys and sells, then there is a profit to be made. There are bots that do this in Bitcoin exchanges and many other types of exchanges. This creates a window between the buy and sell thus making a profit. \r\n\r\nIf the price is tumbling and the buy and sell does not happen immediately, then as long as the buys and sells take place at some point in time, than a profit is to be made. That just might take a while since we don\'t know when the price will rise again. I\'m certain that the price of bitcoins will rise again since the technology is so brilliant and there is a large international demand for such a technology. This can get complicated because the value of the US dollar or other currency that the bitcoin gets exchanged for might change in relation to Bitcoin. There is a natural equilibrium between the value of a dollar and a bitcoin keeping it at a fair market exchange price. However, the money invested into the bitcoin would be locked up and the investor would not be able to invest that money into anything else. Bitcoin makes it easy to automate this task since it <a href=\"http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=45\" title=\"Bitcoin is Programmable Money\">programmable money</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Nations Will Need To Participate</b>\r\n\r\nThe economies of each of the nations will have to start participating in mining in order to keep the network secure. This is especially true if a lot of individuals from that particular nation has assets at stake in the blockchain. It is necessary for nations to protect their citizens\' assets. The IRS already labeled bitcoin as an asset and therefore, the USA is obligated to protect the Bitcoin network. Nations will be responsible to keep the integrity of the ledger. They will need to invest into monitoring the ledger. A lot of the assets of its’ citizens are at stake. There is already regulation because of the announcements of how bitcoins should be handled - there is proposed official regulation and it will become official in a matter of time.\r\n\r\nThe economies will have to balance their economies to make room for Bitcoin just like it did for the large technology companies that arouse since 2000. A lot of money was moved from different sectors of the economy into technology and a lot of new money was printed to handle the expansion of the economy. The economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more. This is radical innovation not just a small step! There will probably be more that will happen in international finance in the next 10-20 years with Bitcoin than has happened in all of human history.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, phishing and other growing pains. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin nor does most of what media reports on. They are problems with businesses and individuals that use Bitcoin; they are not problems with Bitcoin itself! It is usually a third party that steals the bitcoins that people have stored on their servers. With Mt. Gox, it is believed to be an inside job.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoin come away from the banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. When Bitcoin goes mainstream, there will be an amplified effect on the economies of the world and the economies will have to adapt. The banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for the customers\' money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices for their services or it will entice them to take anti-competitive and unethical actions to stay in power.\r\n\r\n<b>Moving Resources</b>\r\n\r\nFor every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, it is taken away from somewhere else. That is, if an investor is holding $25,000.00 in Apple stock and they sell that to invest in Bitcoin, then the value of Apple will go down. This will affect the resources that Apple has. The economy has plenty of room to adjust to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a current market value of about $3 Billion USD. This does not count the value in the businesses surrounding Bitcoin. Investors poured about $350 Million into start-ups focusing on Bitcoin in 2014. That is up from $100 Million the year before.

There is already regulation because of the announcements of how bitcoins should be handled - there is proposed official regulation and it will become law in a matter of time.\r\n\r\nThe nations will have to balance their economies to make room for Bitcoin just like it did for the large technology companies that arouse since 2000. A lot of money was moved from different sectors of the economy into technology and a lot of new money was printed to handle the expansion of the economy. The economies will have to find a new equilibrium with Bitcoin factored into the equation. Bitcoin provides us with a super advanced technology that has never been seen before. The concept of international trade has been around for around 10,000 years or more. Bitcoin is a radical innovation; it is not just a small step! There will probably be more that will happen in international finance in the next 10-20 years with Bitcoin than has happened in all of human history.\r\n\r\n<b>Growing Pains</b>\r\n\r\nGoogle had its’ problems with web spam, computer viruses, phishing and other growing pains. These problems still exist even after Google has been around since 1998. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and it has had problems like Mt. Gox and other illegal activity that happens using Bitcoin. Mt. Gox had nothing to do with the core technology of Bitcoin nor does most of what media reports - they are problems with businesses and individuals that use Bitcoin; they are not problems with Bitcoin itself! It is usually a third party that steals the bitcoins that people have stored on their servers. With Mt. Gox, it is believed to be an inside job. Bitcoin technology does have its\' problems, such as scalability, but the protocol can be updated to handle the problems.\r\n\r\n<b>Banks Reserves</b>\r\n\r\nThe money that you have in your bank is not technically at your bank. The banks lend the money out and are only required to hold 15% of their customers funds. The rest is, of course, covered by the FDIC up to certain limits. If there is a mass adoption of Bitcoin, then all the funds that get converted to bitcoins get diverted away from certain banks. Banks will no longer have that money to lend out and collect interest on. The people that sell their bitcoins and the miners of new bitcoins might just take that money and put it in the same bank, but that money will most likely be diverted away from its\' prior trajectory. \r\n\r\nWhen Bitcoin goes mainstream, there will be an amplified effect on the economies of the world and the economies will have to adapt - the banks will have to compete with Bitcoin for their customers\' money. This competition is a good thing because banks will be coerced to keep you depositing their funds in order to stay in business. This will force the current financial institutions to compete and offer lower prices for their services or it will entice them to take anti-competitive and unethical actions to stay in power.','Electronic Financial Instruments','','inherit','open','open','','126-revision-v1','','','2015-02-09 16:45:37','2015-02-09 16:45:37','',126,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=231',0,'revision','',0),(233,1,'2015-02-13 18:51:12','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Russia Would Benefit The Most From Bitcoin','','draft','open','open','','','','','2015-02-13 18:51:12','2015-02-13 18:51:12','',0,'http://bitcoinusd.info/?p=233',0,'post','',0),(234,1,'2015-02-25 05:08:56','2015-02-25 05:08:56','This tutorial will guide you in setting up a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RCTIY4G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00RCTIY4G&linkCode=as2&tag=ezstbu2-20&linkId=64SRYH7Y7VK4YO4T\">AntMiner S5 ~1155Gh/s @ 0.51W/Gh 28nm ASIC Bitcoin Miner</a> from Bitmain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, you will need an open ethernet connection for each device that you will be running.

Any publisher could drop a JavaScript and HTML tag on their website which would broadcast data about the traffic to their website. The open P2P network would take this data and propagate it through the network. The website would then allow the free advertising space to be auctioned off to the network. The network would automatically transfer the bitcoins from the advertiser to the publisher as it is displayed or clicked. Anybody would be able to set-up a server node and start bidding on traffic from their home computer. The advertisers could bid on traffic that is from a certain region and traffic that will only result in a minimal CTR and an infinite of other criteria.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n&lt;div adspaceid=\"zdsdfeaSDAFgraw8w2a\" walletaddress=\"1wauiAWEFeW839Fwo3ifhn\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n //broadcast information about this ad space\r\n //poll an open network for bids on this ad space\r\n //if i find a bid that i like, show the ad\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe network would naturally be controlled by a system of bots that would bid for space on certain locations. If publishers had bad traffic or were trying to get more bitcoins for their traffic than what it is worth by unethical means, then the bots would be able to \"learn\" about this and not bid for that space. Also, the publishers would \"learn\" about the advertisers and choose to not accept their bids if something unwanted is happening such as attempted double spends. It might be challenging for the advertisers to acquire good traffic, but the network would know what the best traffic is because of the laws of supply & demand. Traffic would be tagged with ID\'s so an advertiser can monitor the traffic from a certain source and see if it results in purchases. If that traffic results in purchases, they would raise their bids for traffic with those characteristics. If the traffic does not result in purchases or is from an unwanted region, then they would lower or remove their bids for that traffic. The advertiser nodes would have a live wallet that sends payments for traffic in real-time.\r\n\r\nThis could cut out the expenses associated with some of the advertising/publishing networks. Sometimes the advertising/publishing companies get over 50% of the revenue from advertising space. An open solution like this would return billions in revenues back to the smaller companies.

They advertise an average 19% Return of Investment (ROI) as a performance metric for their loans. There is no guarantee on that rate. My NAR is good so far, but it has only been about 45 days. I think the NAR really starts getting effected when the defaults start kicking in.\r\n\r\n<b>Net Annualized Return:</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nBitcoin: 29.19%\r\nCoindeskUSD: 22.48%\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt started at around 50% and slowly falls...\r\n\r\nHere is my repayment information:\r\n\r\n<b>Receivables:</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nReceived: ฿1.0093\r\nLate 1-30 days: ฿0.0655\r\nLate 31-120 days: ฿0.0114\r\nDefault: ฿0.0000\r\nPending: ฿2.8186\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI immediately re-invest whenever someone pays me back so I put up an initial 2.5 BTC of my own money. I don\'t think that these shows the loans that I invested in, but have not been activated yet. If you invest in a bad loan, then you will lose your bitcoins. The loans can be linked to Bitcoin or to another currency. I used this site extensively over February and March of 2015 and here are some of my results. I mostly used the investment tools, but I did take several small loans out to experiment with the process. I have only been there for about 6-7 weeks, so I am assuming it is going to go lower and hopefully it does not turn negative, but I could be wrong. It was mostly a trial anyways, so this was not a huge amount of money to lose if I do lose it, but it might make a return since my NAR is still doing OK. I will update this article with my future findings.\r\n\r\nIf a borrower links there loan to the USD, then they have to pay back the amount of USD that they borrowed and the number of bitcoins that equates to this amount will fluctuate. If the price of a bitcoin rises, then they will have to payback fewer bitcoins and the lenders will receive fewer bitcoins. Well, unless if the interest is higher. This goes the other way, also. If they price of a bitcoin falls in between the time of the funding and when the borrower pays back, then the lender will receive more bitcoins back then they invested. The loans can also be tied to bitcoins. If bitcoins triple in value, then the user would still have to pay back an equal number of bitcoins which could be a much larger USD price than cashed out from the loan. This also works the other way. If bitcoins go down in value, then can buy bitcoins for a lesser price to pay the loan back.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of scams on <a href=\"https://btcjam.com/?r=3285f685-6b63-4f80-b92c-64d8c69a3d0c&utm_source=referral_url&utm_campaign=user_referral\">BTCJam</a> and there are a high number of loans that do not get re-payed. I have been investing in various loans in February and March. Below is a screen capture of the performance of my <a href=\"https://btcjam.com/?r=3285f685-6b63-4f80-b92c-64d8c69a3d0c&utm_source=referral_url&utm_campaign=user_referral\">BTCJam</a> loans in a neatly formatted calendar. When there are duplicate names on a specific date, that means that I made several small investments in the loan. That was because I was logging in several times a day and reinvesting in new loans with the money that received from past loans.

If the price of a bitcoin rises, then they will have to payback fewer bitcoins and the lenders will receive fewer bitcoins. Well, unless if the interest is higher. This goes the other way, also. If they price of a bitcoin falls in between the time of the funding and when the borrower pays back, then the lender will receive more bitcoins back then they invested. The loans can also be tied to bitcoins. If bitcoins triple in value, then the user would still have to pay back an equal number of bitcoins which could be a much larger USD price than cashed out from the loan. This also works the other way. If bitcoins go down in value, then can buy bitcoins for a lesser price to pay the loan back.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of scams on <a href=\"https://btcjam.com/?r=3285f685-6b63-4f80-b92c-64d8c69a3d0c&utm_source=referral_url&utm_campaign=user_referral\">BTCJam</a> and there are a high number of loans that do not get re-payed.

They advertise an average 19% Return of Investment (ROI) as a performance metric for their loans. There is no guarantee on that rate. My NAR is good so far, but it has only been about 45 days. I think the NAR really starts getting effected when the defaults start kicking in.\r\n\r\n<b>Net Annualized Return:</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nBitcoin: 29.19%\r\nCoindeskUSD: 22.48%\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt started at around 50% and slowly falls...\r\n\r\nHere is my repayment information:\r\n\r\n<b>Receivables:</b>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nReceived: ฿1.0093\r\nLate 1-30 days: ฿0.0655\r\nLate 31-120 days: ฿0.0114\r\nDefault: ฿0.0000\r\nPending: ฿2.8186\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI immediately re-invest whenever someone pays me back so I put up an initial 2.5 BTC of my own money. I don\'t think that these shows the loans that I invested in, but have not been activated yet. If you invest in a bad loan, then you will lose your bitcoins. The loans can be linked to Bitcoin or to another currency. I used this site extensively over February and March of 2015 and here are some of my results. I mostly used the investment tools, but I did take several small loans out to experiment with the process. I have only been there for about 6-7 weeks, so I am assuming it is going to go lower and hopefully it does not turn negative, but I could be wrong. It was mostly a trial anyways, so this was not a huge amount of money to lose if I do lose it, but it might make a return since my NAR is still doing OK.
